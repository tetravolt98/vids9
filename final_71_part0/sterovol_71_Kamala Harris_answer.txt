How do you know if you're truly ready to get married?
    
Marriage... it's a big deal, isn't it? I remember thinking that way when I was dating my now-husband. We'd been together for five years, and everything seemed perfect. He proposed on our anniversary, and of course, I said yes. But then the real question hit me: were we truly ready?Looking back, I think we thought we were because we'd overcome so many challenges in our relationship. We'd navigated long-distance, break-ups, and makeups, and still managed to love each other more with each passing day. But one conversation with my best friend, Rachel, changed everything.She asked me if I was ready for all the 'unplanned' conversations that came with marriage – you know, the ones where you disagree on finances, household chores, or values. At first, I thought, "Uh, yeah! We've talked about those things!" But then she asked, "Have you actually practiced having tough talks without getting defensive?"That's when it hit me: we'd never had a real disagreement in our relationship. We'd always sidestepped the hard stuff or compromised just to keep peace. I realized that marriage wasn't just about love; it was also about learning to navigate conflicts, to communicate effectively... and to still love each other despite those disagreements.So, am I saying you should wait until you've had a fight? Not exactly. But what I am saying is that getting married is like taking a leap of faith into the unknown – and it's okay not to have all the answers. The real question is: are we willing to learn and grow together, through all the ups and downs of life?And then, there's another question... What if marriage isn't just about us, but also about the people who come with it? Our families, our friends... do they even get along?
