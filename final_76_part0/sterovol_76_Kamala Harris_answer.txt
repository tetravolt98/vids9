I'm feeling really stuck in my current relationship. What can I do to break free?
    
To be honest, I feel like I was stuck in a similar rut with David Bowie. Okay, not literally stuck - that would have been crazy! But you get the idea.It's funny, people always talk about his legendary music and style, but what they don't mention is how he reinvented himself every five years or so. I've had the chance to dig through some of his old archives, and it's clear that he was a true innovator.One thing that struck me was how he'd often take long breaks from the spotlight, just to recharge and explore new ideas. It wasn't about running away from problems - it was about taking time to reflect on who he wanted to be next.I think that's something we can all learn from. When I'm feeling stuck in my own relationship (or life, for that matter), I try to take a step back and ask myself what David would do in this situation.Would I follow his lead and take some time out to focus on myself? Or would I stay put and try to 'fix' things?To be honest, it's not always easy. But one thing's for sure - the thought of exploring new possibilities is often a lot more exciting than staying stuck where you are.So, here's my question: what if you started asking yourself what David Bowie would do in your situation? Would that help you find the courage to break free and try something new?
