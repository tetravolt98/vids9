How do you deal with friends who always cancel plans at the last minute?
    
Oh boy, I've had my fair share of dealing with flakes over the years, but one particular friend comes to mind. Her name is Emily, and we met in college through a mutual friend. We instantly clicked, bonding over our love for adventure, good food, and bad puns.At first, it was just a casual "Hey, wanna grab brunch this weekend?" or "Want to come study with me tonight?" But as time went on, I noticed a pattern emerging. Emily would consistently cancel plans at the last minute, without so much as a heads-up. It got to the point where I'd make plans, and then spend hours wondering if she was going to show up.One time, we had planned a spontaneous road trip to the beach for the weekend. I packed my bags, and we even made a playlist (yes, really). But when Saturday morning rolled around, Emily texted me saying she couldn't make it because "something unexpected came up." As in, every week, with every plan.It was frustrating, to say the least. But what really got under my skin was that she'd always apologize profusely afterwards, and then promptly forget about the whole thing. I mean, how can you just cancel plans without a second thought, and then act like it's no big deal when your friend is hurt?I tried talking to her about it, but she swore it wasn't intentional, that she was just having "too many things going on" in her life. So, what do you do with friends who consistently flake? Do I cut them loose and focus on people who value my time, or am I being too harsh?
