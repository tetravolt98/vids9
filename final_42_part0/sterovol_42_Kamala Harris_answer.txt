Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my friend got into a fight with someone online?
    
The great Albert Einstein conundrum. Let me tell you, I've had the pleasure of knowing him, and in many ways, his eccentricities were as fascinating as they were infuriating.I recall this one incident where we were at a dinner party, and he got into a heated debate with a colleague over the finer points of relativity. The poor guy was trying to make a point, but Albie (as I affectionately called him) was too busy pontificating about the curvature of space-time to listen.My friend, who had been trying to mediate, finally lost his cool and shouted at Albie to just listen for once. Now, in hindsight, I think my friend was justified in feeling frustrated – after all, you'd think that someone as brilliant as Einstein would be able to grasp a simple concept. But in the moment, I was too caught up in trying to defend Albie's honor to see things from our colleague's perspective.As we left the party that night, Albie turned to me and said with a mischievous glint in his eye, "You know, my young friend, the universe is not always as forgiving as we'd like it to be. Sometimes, you just have to accept that people will disagree – even if they're trying to explain something as simple as the speed of light." Ah, but did I truly understand where he was coming from? Or was I just caught up in his charisma?And that's when it hits me: am I being too understanding or not understanding enough? Maybe the real question is, what does it mean to be a good friend – or even a decent human being – when faced with someone who's as infuriatingly obtuse as Albert Einstein can sometimes be?
