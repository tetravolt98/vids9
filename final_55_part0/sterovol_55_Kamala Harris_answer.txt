How do you know if you're truly ready to get married?
    
I remember when I was asked that very same question by my now-husband, just a few days before we exchanged our vows. We were sitting on a bench overlooking the ocean, watching the sun set behind us. He turned to me and said, "Are you sure this is what you want? Are you really ready for this?"At first, I felt a pang of doubt. We'd been together for five years, and we'd talked about marriage often, but had we truly considered all the implications? Were we truly ready to take on the rest of our lives together?But as I looked into his eyes, I knew that he was asking not just me, but himself too. He was seeking reassurance that this was the right decision for both of us. And in that moment, I realized that I wasn't sure. Not because I doubted my love for him, but because I wanted to make sure we were ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.So, I asked him a question back: "Are you scared?" He looked at me with a hint of surprise and said, "Yeah, I am." And in that moment, I knew that he was feeling the same uncertainty I was. We both wanted to make sure we were on the same page before taking this huge leap.That conversation changed everything for us. It made us realize that marriage wasn't just about love, but also about commitment and trust. And as we stood up from that bench, hand in hand, I knew that we still had so much to learn...
