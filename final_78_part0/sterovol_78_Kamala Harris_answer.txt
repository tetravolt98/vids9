Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any common interests?
    
I've always thought of myself as a bit of an outsider when it comes to relationships. I mean, I'm not one of those people who swoons over romance novels or can recite Shakespearean sonnets from memory (although I do appreciate a good love poem every now and then).But what's struck me is how often I've seen friends and acquaintances fall into this trap: they're drawn to someone because of their looks, social status, or whatever other superficial qualities you can think of – only to find out later that they have nothing in common.I'm thinking specifically about my friend Emma. We were all part of a tight-knit group of friends back in college, and there was this one guy, Alex... let's just say he had it all going on: the dreamy eyes, chiseled jawline, and an effortless charm that could light up a room. Emma fell hard for him, and I couldn't help but be thrilled for her.But as we spent more time with them together, I started to notice how... disconnected they were. They'd go out on "dates" where Alex would spend the entire evening scrolling through his phone, while Emma would get increasingly frustrated because he wasn't even listening to her. It was like watching two people pretend to be in love, but really just going through the motions.And then one day, Emma confided in me that she'd been feeling this creeping sense of unease whenever they were together... not because of anything Alex had done (he's actually a super nice guy), but because it felt so forced. She was starting to realize that their relationship wasn't just built on romance – but also on a shared disinterest in, well, almost everything.Now, here's where things get interesting: I've always wondered what would happen if you took those two people and put them through some kind of "interest challenge" – force them to have fun together doing all the weird, obscure stuff that they'd normally never agree on...
