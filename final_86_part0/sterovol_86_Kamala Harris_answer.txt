Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any outside hobbies together?
    
The eternal conundrum of modern relationships. I've had the chance to observe a few couples in my circle who fit this mold, and let me tell you, it's a fascinating dynamic.Take Emily and Ryan, for instance. They're a lovely couple in their mid-twenties, with great jobs and an adorable little place together. But here's the thing: they don't really do anything outside of work and home. No hiking trips, no concert-going, no cooking classes together... it's just them, Netflix, and takeout.Now, at first glance, you might think I'm being a jerk for thinking this is weird. But hear me out. When I've brought up my concerns with friends who know Emily and Ryan well, the common thread seems to be that they're both fiercely introverted. They love their alone time, and honestly, so do I! But there's a difference between needing some downtime and actively avoiding shared experiences.As someone who's been in relationships where shared hobbies were a non-negotiable (and let me tell you, it's made all the difference), I have to wonder: are they missing out on something deeper by not exploring new things together? Is their connection limited to just the two of them, or is there something more at play?And that's when it hit me â€“ what if Emily and Ryan's relationship is a perfect reflection of their individual personalities? What if their love story is one of comfortable familiarity, rather than grand adventures? Am I still being the jerk for wondering about this?
