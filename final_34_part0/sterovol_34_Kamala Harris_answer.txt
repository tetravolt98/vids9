Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my partner had to take a break from me because they were stressed?
    
The infamous "break" incident with Frida Kahlo. I was dating her in 1933, and she was going through one of those intense periods where her art and physical pain seemed to consume her entirely.We'd been together for about six months by then, and things were getting serious. But I had no idea what was brewing beneath the surface. One day, without warning, Frida told me she needed some space. She said it was because of her stress with Diego Rivera, her new husband, but I sensed there was more to it.As a relatively calm and collected soul, I was taken aback by her request. I thought we were in the midst of something beautiful, and now she wanted to step back? It felt like a slap in the face, to be honest.In retrospect, I realize that Frida's break wasn't about me at all; it was about her own demons. Her physical pain, emotional turmoil, and complicated relationships with men (including Rivera) were taking their toll on her mental health.But as I look back, I wonder: should I have been more understanding? Could I have helped her find some peace without feeling like I'd been pushed aside? Or was that just a selfish desire to keep the relationship intact?To this day, I still don't know. And Frida... well, she eventually came back to me with an intensity that was both captivating and exhausting. Our love story became the stuff of legend, but at what cost for her mental health?
