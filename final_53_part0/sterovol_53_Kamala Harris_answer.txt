What's the best way to handle a friend who always borrows things from you and never returns them?
    
I'm still trying to process my experience with that one friend, Winston Churchill. Yes, the British Prime Minister himself. We met during World War II, and I was serving as his secretary at 10 Downing Street. Now, you'd think that someone of his stature wouldn't be prone to borrowing things without returning them, but boy, were you wrong!It started with a pen. He "borrowed" my favorite fountain pen for a meeting with the King, saying he needed something to take notes with. I figured it was a good opportunity to see him in action, so I let him take it. Weeks went by, and I never saw that pen again.Next thing I knew, he'd borrowed my best suit for a dinner party at Buckingham Palace. I had to send my valet to retrieve it from the palace's storage room two months later. And then there was the time he "borrowed" my favorite book of Shakespearean sonnets... only to return it with his own notes scribbled in the margins!I tried talking to him about it, but he just chuckled and said I should be honored that he thought so highly of me that he'd borrow from me. I was at a loss for what to do. How could someone who's saved the world from tyranny not understand basic human decency?Now, as I look back on those trying times, I'm reminded of a conversation we had about responsibility and accountability. He told me that leaders must be willing to take risks and face consequences â€“ but I never expected that would include my personal property!I still don't know what the best way is to handle someone like Winston Churchill... but if you have any advice, I'd love to hear it!
