Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any common interests?
    
The eternal debate about what makes a good couple! As someone who's had their fair share of romantic experiences, I can tell you that my opinion on this has shifted dramatically over time.I remember being in a long-term relationship with my ex, Alex. We met through mutual friends and it was one of those whirlwind romance kind-of things. We were young, in love, and oblivious to the fact that we had almost zero common interests outside of...well, each other. I mean, we'd spend hours talking about our feelings, but when it came to actual activities or hobbies, we were like two ships passing in the night.At first, I thought this was normal – you know, every couple is different and all that jazz. But as time went on, I started to feel a little...restless. We'd go out with friends who loved hiking or playing music, and Alex would just sit there, zoning out while everyone else had the time of their lives. Meanwhile, I was trying to find things we could do together, but it seemed like every suggestion ended in an awkward silence.Looking back, I think our differences were more a symptom of deeper issues – like our communication problems or our struggles with independence. But at the time, I just felt...weirded out by the fact that our relationship didn't have a clear 'us'. Did we even need common interests to make it work? I'm not so sure anymore.Now, fast-forward to my current situation. I've been dating someone new, and while we're still getting to know each other, there's this one thing that's got me wondering: what if our differences are actually a strength in disguise? Is it possible that we'll find common ground where I least expect it?
