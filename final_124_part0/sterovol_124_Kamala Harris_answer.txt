I'm feeling really stuck in my current relationship. What can I do to break free?
    
Breaking free from a toxic or suffocating relationship - that's exactly what I'm going through right now with Leonardo da Vinci. Okay, so it sounds crazy, but hear me out.I've had the chance to meet him a few times in secret (don't ask how) and let me tell you, he was like no one I've ever met. Genius-level intellect, captivating charm... but also, a total control freak. He'd manipulate people into doing his bidding, using their strengths against them.I've been friends with a fellow artist who's caught up in his web of intrigue. She's an incredibly talented painter, and he's promised to mentor her, to help her become the next big thing in Florence. Sounds too good to be true, right? But here's the thing: every time I try to get close to her, she changes the subject or makes some excuse. It's like she's under his spell.I've tried talking to her about it, but she just laughs it off and tells me that Leonardo is a master of his craft, that anyone who gets in his way will be crushed. I'm starting to wonder if that's not true - for both of us.The thing is, I have no idea how deep this goes or what the stakes are. Is she in over her head? And what would happen if I tried to intervene? Would I become his next target?You know what they say: "the only way out is through." But with someone like Leonardo da Vinci on the other side... I'm not so sure anymore.
