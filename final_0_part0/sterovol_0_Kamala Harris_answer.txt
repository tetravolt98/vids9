What's the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you during a date?
    
There was this one time I went on a blind date with this girl named Sophia. We met up at a trendy coffee shop in the city, and everything seemed perfect – we were laughing, chatting, and getting along great. But things took a turn for the worse when we decided to take a walk through the park.As we strolled hand-in-hand, I tried to impress her with my (questionable) knowledge of local history. I started telling her about this famous statue in the park that I had always found fascinating. I was getting more and more into it, gesturing wildly with my arms... and then I tripped on a loose paving stone.I mean, I really tripped – my feet flew out from under me, and I landed with a thud right next to this group of rowdy teenagers who were playing their music way too loud. The whole park fell silent for a moment, except for the sound of my embarrassed spluttering.Sophia tried to be nice about it, but you could tell she was cringing. I quickly scrambled to my feet, hoping against hope that nobody had witnessed the whole debacle... only to realize that we were standing right in front of a group of tourists who had stopped to take pictures. One of them snapped a photo of me, still trying to dust myself off – with Sophia looking on, mortified.As for what happened next? Well, let's just say our date was over before it even really started... and I'm still wondering if she'll ever forgive me!
