How do you deal with the stress of planning a wedding?
    
The infamous wedding planning experience - I'll never forget it! My sister was getting married to her high school sweetheart, and as the maid of honor, I took it upon myself to be the ultimate planner. Little did I know that it would become an all-consuming, soul-crushing adventure.At first, it seemed like a breeze. We'd meet with vendors, taste cake samples (yes, multiple times), and swoon over Pinterest-perfect decor ideas. But as the months ticked by, the excitement began to wane, replaced by a nagging sense of unease. Should we go for the cheaper venue or splurge on the fancy one? Do we really need a photo booth when we could just hire a photographer?I recall one particularly brutal argument with my sister over the seating chart - she wanted her 10-year-old cousin to sit at the kid's table, while I thought it was a nightmare waiting to happen. We went back and forth for hours, both of us convinced that our way was the only civilized choice. I swear, it got so heated that our mom had to intervene.And then there were the guests - oh, the guests! Who do we invite? How many will actually come? Will my aunt bring her infamous three-day-old tuna casserole as a "gift"? The questions swirled in my head like a maelstrom of anxiety.But amidst all the chaos and drama, I remember one particularly serendipitous moment. We stumbled upon an incredible local musician who offered to play at the wedding for just $200 - a steal compared to the industry standard. It was then that I realized even amidst the madness, there were hidden gems waiting to be discovered.Now, as I sit here thinking about it all, I wonder... what if we had done things differently? Would the stress have been worth it in the end? Had my sister and her fianc√© actually planned their wedding on their own without me, would they have created an even more magical day?
