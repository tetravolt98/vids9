What's the best way to handle a friend who always borrows things from you and never returns them?
    
I've had my fair share of dealing with friends like that, and I'm still trying to figure out what works best. You see, I used to be pretty much everyone's "go-to" person for borrowing stuff - clothes, books, gadgets... you name it. And at first, it was no big deal. I mean, I was happy to help out a friend in need.But over time, the requests started piling up, and I began to feel like I was running a charity for my friends instead of just having friendships. Like, I'd lend them something, and then they wouldn't even bother to thank me or mention it again. It was as if I'd never loaned them anything in the first place.One friend in particular comes to mind - let's call her Sarah. She borrowed my favorite jacket for a concert, and then proceeded to wear it to like five other events after that. I'm talking weddings, parties... you get the idea. And when I asked her about it, she just shrugged it off and said, "Oh, sorry, I forgot it was yours!" Yeah, right.Anyway, I finally had to put my foot down with Sarah. We got into a bit of an argument about it, but in the end, she apologized and promised to return some stuff (although we're still waiting on that concert ticket she borrowed...).So, what's the best way to handle friends like this? Honestly, I'm not sure yet. Part of me thinks you just have to be clear upfront - "Hey, if you borrow something from me, please let me know and return it ASAP." But another part of me wonders if that approach can actually work... after all, people are people, right?
