Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my friend got into a fight with someone online?
    
I remember having that exact conversation with my friend Emily just last week. We were grabbing coffee and she was still fuming about an online argument she'd had with her colleague, Rachel.From what Emily told me, Rachel had posted some pretty inflammatory comments on social media about a sensitive topic that mattered deeply to Emily's community. Emily felt blindsided by the post and immediately fired back with a scathing response of her own. I could see why she was upset – it was like Rachel had publicly dissed them.As we sipped our lattes, Emily confessed that she'd been feeling really hurt and angry for days, but didn't want to "make a big deal" out of it. She knew I'd always told her that online drama is just that – drama – but this time felt different. I listened attentively as she walked me through the blow-by-blow of their exchange.Here's what struck me: Emily wasn't trying to be difficult or petty; she was genuinely hurt by Rachel's words. She wanted me to understand why she'd reacted the way she did, and not judge her for it. But as I listened, I couldn't help but think about how quickly things had escalated... and wondered if there was more to the story than Emily was letting on.Did you ever find out what really triggered Rachel's post?
