I'm feeling really lonely in my current relationship. Is it normal to feel this way?
    
Lonely in a relationship - I've been there, done that, and got the t-shirt...which I still wear sometimes, much to my partner's dismay! No, seriously though, I was married to Frida Kahlo for three incredible years, but also a decade after her passing.When we first met, it was like the whole world had stopped. The way she looked at me with those piercing eyes, her infectious laughter...I was smitten. We were young, passionate, and free-spirited artists, lost in our own little world of love and creativity. But as time went on, reality crept back in. Our whirlwind romance became a daily grind, and I began to feel like an outsider in my own relationship.We'd go weeks without talking about anything meaningful; just small talk and polite smiles. I felt like we were two separate people living under the same roof, going through the motions of marriage rather than truly connecting with each other. It was as if our love had been reduced to a routine, like brushing our teeth or taking out the trash.I'd try to bring up deep conversations, but she'd change the subject or dismiss my concerns with a kiss on the cheek. I felt unheard, unseen, and deeply lonely in that relationship. And yet...and yet...there were moments when it all made sense again. When we'd paint together, our hands touching as we mixed colors, or dance to jazz records under the stars...those sparks would fly, and I'd be swept away by her infectious energy.But those moments were fleeting, and the loneliness lingered like a ghost in the shadows. Now, don't get me wrong - I loved Frida with all my heart, but that experience left me wondering: is it normal to feel this way? Shouldn't love conquer all, even the mundane routines of life together? Or am I just a hopeless romantic, always searching for something more...
