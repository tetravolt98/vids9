Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my partner had to take a break from me because they were stressed?
    
The infamous Albert Camus - or, as I knew him, Albie. I met him in the 1950s, during his time at the University of Algiers. He was this charming, rugged Frenchman with a penchant for philosophy and a quick wit that could charm the birds from the trees.I was a young student myself, and our conversations would often meander into the wee hours of the morning, fueled by coffee and debate. I was fascinated by his views on the absurdity of life, and he'd regale me with stories of his time as an Algerian resistance fighter during World War II.One evening, we were deep in discussion when he suddenly excused himself to take a break. He explained that he needed some space to clear his head - something about the weight of the world bearing down on him. I remember thinking it was just another one of his philosophical rants, but now I see it as a cry for help.I wish I had been more understanding back then. As it turned out, Albie was struggling with his own demons, and that break he took was a desperate attempt to gather himself. I pushed him away, thinking he was just being dramatic. But what if I'd listened? What if I'd offered him the support he so desperately needed?Looking back, I realize that my insensitivity was a small part of a larger pattern - one that I'm still trying to untangle today. So, am I the jerk for not being more understanding? I don't know... and it's a question that haunts me to this day.
