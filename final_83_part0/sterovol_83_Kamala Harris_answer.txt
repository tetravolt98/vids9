How do you deal with friends who always cancel plans at the last minute?
    
The eternal conundrum of dealing with flaky friends! I've got a personal story that might resonate with you. So, I had this friend – let's call her Emma – we met in college, and she became one of my closest confidantes. We'd make plans to grab coffee or catch a movie, and I always made sure to give her plenty of notice so she could clear her schedule.But somehow, no matter how early I gave her the heads-up, she'd inevitably cancel on me at the last minute. At first, it was just a few times a semester, but over time, it became more frequent. I started to feel like I was always on edge, wondering if we'd actually follow through with plans or not.I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe she was just really busy or had other priorities... but deep down, I knew that wasn't the whole story. It seemed like every time we made plans, something "came up" – a family emergency, a work project, or even a spontaneous road trip with friends (yes, you read that right!).I felt frustrated and ignored, wondering if my plans were ever truly important to her. I started to wonder: was I just an afterthought in our friendship? Did she value me only when it was convenient for her?And then, one day... she canceled on me again, with a half-hearted apology text that said she had "other commitments" and would "catch up soon." That's when I realized I needed to reevaluate this friendship. Do I deserve better? Should I take the hint and prioritize my own needs? And most importantly: what does it say about me that I've been putting up with this behavior for so long?
