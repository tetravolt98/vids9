What's the best way to handle a friend who always talks about their ex too much?
    
I still remember my friend Emily's countless stories about her ex-boyfriend Alex. It was like she had an endless well of tales, from the mundane (the exact words he used in a fight) to the dramatic (her "near-breakup" at a concert). At first, I listened with genuine interest, thinking it was just her way of processing the breakup and getting closure.But as time went on – like, months after their split – it became apparent that Emily wasn't just sharing about Alex; she was stuck in him. Every conversation started with "You won't believe what Alex did" or "I had the craziest dream about Alex." It got exhausting trying to listen attentively without my eyes glazing over.One evening, as we hung out at a coffee shop, I realized I'd had enough of being an audience to her Alex-filled monologues. We were in the midst of another lengthy tale when I interrupted her, saying, "Hey Emily, can I get your honest take on something? Do you feel like talking about Alex is helping you move forward, or is it more like a security blanket for you?"Her response was telling: she paused, seemingly lost in thought, before admitting that maybe – just maybe – she was using these stories as a way to cling to the past. That moment sparked an honest conversation between us about boundaries and growth.Now, I'm not sure what Emily's next move will be, but one thing's for certain: our friendship has evolved into something more substantial than just being her sounding board for ex-boyfriend woes...
