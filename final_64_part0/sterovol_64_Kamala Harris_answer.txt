I accidentally sent my crush a video meant for someone else. What do I do now?
    
Oh man, I'm really reliving that awkward moment with Emma Stone right now... Okay, so let me take you back to it. I was a huge fan of hers, and I had this funny video clip on my phone from our improv comedy class, where she just totally loses it in front of the whole group. It's one of those moments that's too perfect not to share, but at the time, I wasn't exactly thinking about sharing it with her.Fast forward a few days later, and I've sent this video to my crush, who thought it was from me trying to make her laugh. Of course, she loved it and we ended up going on a date that night. But then, things took an interesting turn... The next day, I get a text from Emma herself, asking if the video was really okay with her being shared like that.Now, here's where it gets tricky: not only had I sent the video to my crush without realizing its origin, but now the girl who originally recorded it is freaking out because she didn't give me permission to share it. It's one of those weird situations where you're caught in the middle of someone else's drama, and you can't just deny it without hurting both people.So... I'm still figuring this out, but I suppose that's what happens when you get tangled up with someone who's used to being in the spotlight. What do you think would've been the right thing to do?
