Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any common interests?
    
I've got a personal story that might make you think twice about this. So, I'm a huge fan of David Bowie's music, and back in college, my then-girlfriend was obsessed with his style – I mean, who isn't, right? But what really surprised me was when we started dating, I discovered she knew nothing about his music. I thought to myself, "This is weird. He's the ultimate artist, and you don't even know one of his songs?"As it turned out, my girlfriend was actually more into the glam rock scene, but her favorite band wasn't Bowie – it was T-Rex! She loved Marc Bolan's style and energy, and I have to admit, his music is pretty cool too. But what really got me thinking was when we started going to concerts together. We'd see bands from our respective "sides" of the glam rock world, and while we'd dance together, I couldn't help but notice how differently she experienced the shows.She'd get lost in the psychedelic light shows, while I'd be headbanging to the guitars. It was like we were experiencing two entirely different concerts. And yet... it worked for us. We'd geek out about our favorite artists and bands separately, but when we came together, there was this spark of shared enthusiasm that was hard to ignore.Looking back, maybe not having "common interests" isn't as weird as I thought at first. Maybe it's just a sign of two people who are willing to explore different worlds, but still find common ground in each other. Now, here's the thing: what if you're the one with no shared interests? Would you be okay with that... or would you feel like something's missing?
