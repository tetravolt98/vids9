Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any common interests?
    
I've got a friend who always says that's just not a good idea, but let me tell you about my sister and her husband. They met in college, and on paper, they were a match made in heaven - same major, same social circle... but when I dug deeper, I realized they had zero common interests outside of their social lives.At first, it seemed fine. They'd go to parties together, attend the same events, and just kind of exist in each other's presence. But as time went on, I started to notice that they'd spend hours scrolling through their phones, not really interacting with each other. My sister would tell me about her day, but only if it was related to work or school - personal stuff? Forget about it.One night, we all went out for dinner, and my brother-in-law spent the entire meal talking to a friend at the next table while my sister just sat there, playing with her phone. I brought up this exact topic afterwards, thinking maybe they'd talk about getting more involved in some kind of activity together... but instead, she just shrugged it off like it was no big deal.Fast-forward a year or so: they're still married, and from what I can tell, their relationship is still going strong. My sister's happy, her husband seems to be too... but sometimes I wonder if that's really enough? Is it okay to just coast through life with someone without any real shared passions or interests?Now, I'm not saying they're a bad couple - I genuinely love them both - but I do think there's something to be said for having those deeper connections. Am I the jerk for thinking that's weird? Maybe... maybe I'm just wondering if it's possible to have too much of a good thing?
