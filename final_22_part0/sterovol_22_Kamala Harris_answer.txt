Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any inside jokes?
    
I've had a front-row seat to the quirks of some fascinating individuals, and one couple in particular comes to mind. My friend Emily was dating Alex, a charming and laid-back guy who always made her laugh. One thing that struck me about their relationship, though, was how few inside jokes they seemed to share.At first, I thought it was cute – like they were still in the "I'm-so-in-love-with-you" phase where everything they said or did together was hilarious. But as time went on, I started to notice that every conversation with them felt kind of... surface-level. They'd talk about their days, their plans for the weekend, but nothing really seemed to be a private joke, something only they understood.One evening over dinner, Alex made a wry comment about Emily's cooking, and she deadpanned back that it was "a real recipe for disaster." I laughed along with them, thinking it was funny, but in hindsight, maybe it was just a fluke. They never repeated or built on that joke; it just sort of... existed.Now, am I the jerk for thinking their relationship feels somehow incomplete without inside jokes? Or are they actually onto something more profound – a partnership that's all about shared experiences and genuine connection, rather than relying on cheesy one-liners and private humor?
