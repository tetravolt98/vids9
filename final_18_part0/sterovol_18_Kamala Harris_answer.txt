Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my partner had to work late again?
    
I think I have a bit of insight into this one, having lived with Frida Kahlo. Let me tell you, she knew all about frustration and feeling like everyone else was getting in the way.Her husband, Diego Rivera, was an artist too - and a bit of a womanizer. He'd often cancel their plans at the last minute to paint or attend some social gathering, leaving Frida feeling abandoned and hurt. I'm sure you can relate to that feeling of being left behind.But here's the thing: Frida's not just known for her art, she's also known for her strength and resilience in the face of adversity. And what was her biggest challenge? A bus accident at 18 that left her with chronic pain, multiple surgeries, and a lifetime of physical limitations. That's like having to work late every night, if you will.When Diego would cancel plans or come home late, Frida wouldn't get angry - she'd just paint it out. She'd channel her emotions into her art, creating some of the most beautiful and provocative pieces of her time. And when I say provoke, I mean really provoke: paintings that were so raw and honest about her pain and heartache that they still give me goosebumps to this day.So, am you the jerk for not being more understanding? Maybe not - but maybe you're just having a Frida moment. When life gets tough, do we lash out or find a way to channel our emotions into something beautiful? The answer's up to us... and I'm still trying to figure it out myself!
