What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever done to get out of doing something you didn't want to do?
    
I'm still chuckling when I think about it... So, it was during my summer break from college, and I had promised my parents that I would volunteer at a local animal shelter for a few weeks. Sounds great, right? Except, I'd rather been looking forward to spending those weeks lounging by the pool with friends.One morning, as we were getting ready to head out to the shelter, I made up this absurd excuse: "Hey guys, I think I might be experiencing a rare medical condition - it's called 'aquatic sensitivity syndrome'." Yeah, I know, real thing. Apparently, it's a side effect of being too close to water for too long.My parents looked at each other, totally confused, and asked me what that meant. So, I launched into this elaborate explanation about how my body had been reacting strangely whenever we were near bodies of water... it was getting hives just thinking about it! (I'm pretty sure they thought I'd finally lost it).To my surprise, they actually started to believe me! They asked me if I really wanted to go to the shelter that day and risk breaking out into an allergic reaction. Um, no thanks? Of course not! So, we ended up coming up with a (completely fictional) plan for me to get tested for this "condition" at the hospital.As we were driving home from our supposedly emergency vet visit, I'm pretty sure they still didn't know what was real and what wasn't... but that's beside the point. Point is: I got out of volunteering at the shelter that day!
