What's the best way to handle a friend who always cancels plans at the last minute?
    
Let me tell you, I've been there with my friend Emma, and it was like being on an emotional rollercoaster. We'd make plans for weeks, and then she'd text me at 10 pm, saying "Hey, something came up, let's reschedule for another time." It happened so often that I started to feel like a backup plan myself.One time, we had tickets to see our favorite band live, and Emma cancelled on me just an hour before the show. She said her family was in town and she couldn't miss them. I was devastated – those tickets were hard-won! But I didn't call her out on it (yet). Instead, I politely asked if we could reschedule for another time.What struck me, though, was that every time Emma cancelled plans, she'd always offer a reasonable-sounding excuse. It made me wonder: was this just a pattern of hers, or was something else going on? Was she genuinely struggling to keep commitments, or was it simply a lack of consideration for others?That's when I started to notice a change in our dynamic. Emma would cancel plans and then guilt-trip me into forgiving her. It felt like I was being manipulated into excusing her behavior, rather than being respected as an equal. That's when the red flag went up – I realized it wasn't just about cancelled plans; it was about respecting my time and boundaries.Now, I'm not sure what to do about Emma or our friendship. Part of me wants to confront her about it all, but another part is scared of jeopardizing our relationship...
