Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my partner had to take a break from me because they were stressed?
    
I've been there, done that, and got the t-shirt. I'm talking, of course, about Albert Camus. Yeah, you read that right – the famous French philosopher.I met him in the 1940s, when I was working as a café owner in Paris. He'd often come in to write and think, and I'd join him for long conversations over coffee. One day, he stormed out of my café, looking like the world was ending. I asked what was wrong, and he told me he was stressed about his latest novel.Now, I'd heard that Camus was known to be a bit...particular when it came to his work. But still, I thought, shouldn't I offer him some understanding? After all, I knew how much writing meant to him. So, I tried to be more understanding, but he just shook me off and said, "No, no, Pierre. You don't get it."It wasn't until years later, when we became friends, that I realized why Camus was so stressed. He'd been working on The Fall, his famous novel about a man's descent into guilt and despair. It was clear to me now that he needed space to work through his emotions, not just more understanding from someone who didn't quite get it.But here's the thing: even with hindsight, I'm still wondering – did I really have to push for more understanding? Or should I have let him be, and given him the space he so desperately needed?
