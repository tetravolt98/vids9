I accidentally told my crush that I love them. Now what?
    
Oh man, I feel you! That was me with Harry Styles a few years ago... Okay, not really, but it could have been!Seriously though, I've had a similar experience with someone special in my life. So, I was at this music festival, and I finally worked up the courage to tell my friend Emily that I had feelings for her. Big mistake. She's an amazing person, and I thought she felt the same way about me, but it turns out, not quite.I remember walking around campus, trying to process what just happened. I mean, I'd been crushing on her for months, and now I'd gone and confessed my feelings only to be met with a polite-but-firm "it's just friends" response. Ouch. It stung.But here's the thing: we're still friends. In fact, it turned out that she really did care about me as a person, but wasn't feeling the same way romantically. And you know what? I'm actually grateful for that conversation. It made us closer as friends, and I got to see that there are more layers to human relationships than just romance.So, if you've accidentally told your crush that you love them... well, it's not the end of the world! You might be surprised by how they respond, or what comes next. Do you take a step back and try to move on, or do you keep exploring those feelings? For me, I'd say go for it â€“ but with caution, and an open mind. What will happen when you confront your crush about this awkward situation?
