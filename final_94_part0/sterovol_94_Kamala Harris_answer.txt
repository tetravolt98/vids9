Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any common interests?
    
I've always been a bit of an observer, so when I'm at social gatherings or just hanging out with friends, I find myself wondering how some relationships work. I mean, take my friend Emily and her boyfriend Mike for example. On the surface, they seem like the perfect couple - they're both in their mid-twenties, great sense of humor, and everyone around them just loves them.But here's the thing: they couldn't be more different when it comes to interests. Emily is a total art geek, always talking about the latest exhibit she's seen or the artist she's currently obsessing over. Mike, on the other hand, lives and breathes sports - he can tell you the stats of every player in the NBA and still manage to get tickets to every game.At first, I thought it was kind of weird that they didn't have more in common, but as I watched them interact with each other, I realized that it's actually not a big deal. They might not be able to bond over art or sports, but they can talk about anything and everything else. And let me tell you, their conversations are always hilarious - Mike is always trying to get Emily excited about some new player, and she's always rolling her eyes good-naturedly.But here's the thing: I've started to wonder if it's okay that they don't have any common interests. Is it weird that they can just coexist without really connecting on a deeper level? And what does that say about their relationship in the long run? Will they be able to grow and evolve together, or will their differences drive them apart? I guess only time will tell...
