I accidentally sent my crush a video meant for someone else. What do I do now?
    
I'm mortified just thinking about it! That was actually me with Harry Styles back in 2019. Okay, so let's just say it was a chaotic time in my life - I'd just gotten out of a long-term relationship and was trying to get my confidence back up after a particularly brutal breakup.Anyway, I had this amazing video of us belting out "Sign of the Times" together at a karaoke night. My best friend's cousin had sent it to me thinking we could use it as a funny inside joke for our next girls' trip... but, of course, I accidentally shared it with Harry Styles himself.I was mortified! I thought my crush would think I'm some kind of creepy stalker or something. But instead... he messaged me back! And not just a quick "whoops" kind of message, either - we had this actual conversation where he asked me what I meant by sharing the video and whether I wanted to grab coffee with him.Long story short (too late for that!), we did end up grabbing coffee and had an amazing time. It was like fate intervened or something! But even now, when I think back on it, I'm still a little unsure about how to navigate those kinds of situations... What do you do when your crush sees the "real" you before you're ready to show them?
