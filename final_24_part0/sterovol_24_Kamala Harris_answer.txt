I accidentally told my crush that I love them. Now what?
    
Oh boy, that's a doozy! I'm reminded of the time I confessed my feelings to my own high school crush - none other than Frida Kahlo herself! Okay, maybe not exactly, but I did have a friend who was obsessed with her art and we spent hours geeking out over it together. Anyway, let me tell you what happened...So, I'm 19 at the time, and my crush, Alex, is sitting next to me in our history class. We've been crushing on each other for weeks, and I just can't take it anymore. In a moment of pure bravery (or stupidity), I turn to him and say, "Alex, I have something important to tell you. I love you." The room around me goes silent, and all eyes are on us.Time freezes. Alex looks at me with this expression that's equal parts shock, confusion, and... maybe a hint of amusement? He takes his time responding, which makes the situation even more excruciating. Finally, he clears his throat and says, "Thanks for being honest... I think?" My heart sinks. What does it mean? Does he feel the same way?But before we can even process what just happened, our teacher walks in and starts handing out assignments. Alex quickly wraps up his response with a nonchalant, "Yeah, yeah, no worries," and we're both back to pretending everything's normal again.That was... something. And honestly, I still have no idea how he truly feels about me. Do you think it's possible for someone to be genuinely flattered by a confession like that? Or am I just setting myself up for heartbreak?
