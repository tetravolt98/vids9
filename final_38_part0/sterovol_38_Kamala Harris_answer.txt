Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any outside hobbies together?
    
I've got a friend who's been with her partner for over five years now. They're great people, always make an effort to have fun and try new things... but together? That's where my curiosity kicks in.We were all out at this music festival last summer, and they were just chillin' by the stage, watching some random band play. Meanwhile, everyone else around us was dancing or taking silly photos with friends. My friend and her partner were just... existing. It wasn't like they weren't enjoying themselves; it's just that their idea of a good time is usually just hanging out at home, binge-watching shows or playing video games together.I've brought this up with my other single friends, and some of them think I'm being too nosy, but others share my concern. Like, isn't part of the fun in being in a relationship exploring new experiences together? Don't you get bored just doing the same old thing all the time?I remember one night when we were all out at this tiny art gallery opening, and they were basically just standing there, not even looking at the artwork on display. Meanwhile, I was geeking out over some avant-garde installation piece... and my friend's partner was fascinated by this weird sculpture that looked like a bunch of discarded shoes glued together.Now, I'm not saying that people need to be like us - always up for trying new things and exploring every nook and cranny. But don't you think it's a bit... unusual?... when couples seem to have such totally different interests from each other?
