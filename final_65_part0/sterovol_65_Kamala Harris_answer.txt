What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever done to get out of doing something you didn't want to do?
    
Oh man, I'm still grinning when I think about it. So, it was during my senior year in college, and our school was having a "Wellness Week" where we were supposed to participate in this mandatory yoga session with the entire student body. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm all for relaxation and whatnot, but I had just gotten tickets to see The Black Keys live that night and I was determined to be at that concert.I knew if I went to yoga, there was no way I'd make it to the show on time, so I came up with this harebrained scheme. I convinced my friend Emma (she's still shaking her head to this day) to help me pull off what we affectionately called "Operation: Yoga-Fu."We snuck into the yoga tent during a particularly intense downward-facing dog session and started pretending to be instructors, wearing ridiculous-looking outfits that looked like a cross between a ninja and a clown. We began shouting out random yoga poses and phrases, trying to blend in with the real instructors.At first, everyone was totally confused – I mean, who expects to have fake yoga instructors yelling at them? But somehow, we managed to keep it up for about 20 minutes without getting caught. The look on our fellow students' faces was priceless, but just as we thought we'd gotten away with it, one of the actual instructors spotted us and started chasing us out of the tent.Now, I'm not proud of what I did – it was a bit mean-spirited, and I'm sure some people were genuinely disappointed to be distracted from their downward-facing dogs. But... did we actually pull off Operation: Yoga-Fu? Or did they catch on before we escaped into the night to grab those Black Keys tickets?
