What's the most memorable date night experience you've ever had?
    
I'll never forget my date night with Frida Kahlo at her home in Mexico City back in the late 1940s. My wife, a fellow artist and long-time admirer of Frida's work, had arranged for us to meet up with Frida and her husband Diego Rivera at their iconic Blue House.As we pulled up to the house, I could feel the excitement building. We were greeted by Frida herself, resplendent in a colorful embroidered dress and her signature unibrow. She welcomed us with a warm smile and invited us into her studio, where she was working on a new painting.The evening unfolded like a dream. We spent hours chatting with Frida and Diego about art, politics, and life in Mexico City during the tumultuous post-revolution era. Frida regaled us with stories of her childhood, her experiences as a woman artist, and her own struggles with physical pain and emotional turmoil.As the night wore on, we made our way to the dining room, where Frida had prepared an exquisite feast of traditional Mexican cuisine. The conversation turned to art, and Diego began to regale us with stories of his own artistic endeavors – including his infamous mural in the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco.But just as things were getting really interesting, I noticed a strange look on Frida's face. She excused herself and stepped out into the garden for some fresh air. Diego leaned over and whispered to me, "You know, she's been working on a new painting – one that's going to change everything." And with that, he winked at me and said, "But you'll just have to wait and see..."
