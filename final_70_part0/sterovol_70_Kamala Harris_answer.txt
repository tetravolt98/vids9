Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any outside hobbies together?
    
You know, I've always been fascinated by the life of Frida Kahlo. She was an amazing artist, but also a true romantic - and her relationship with Diego Rivera is still one of the most iconic in history.Growing up, I was always drawn to Frida's story because she and Diego seemed like they had it all: love, passion, creativity... and yet, their marriage was also tumultuous. They were both super strong-willed individuals who wanted to pursue their own artistic visions, without compromising each other's goals.But what struck me was that despite their intense passion for each other, Frida and Diego didn't really do "couples stuff" together - no joint hobbies, no matching interests... just a deep love for each other. And you know what? That weirdness factor you're talking about? I think it's actually kind of genius.Think about it: in a world where social media is all about curated couples' adventures and matching Instagram aesthetics, Frida and Diego were unapologetically themselves - even when that meant not having outside hobbies together. They didn't feel the need to prove their love by doing stuff as a couple; instead, they poured their energy into their individual passions.Now, I'm not saying it's weird or wrong for couples to have shared interests... but what if I told you that Frida and Diego's unique relationship dynamic actually inspired me? What if I said that it made me wonder: what happens when love isn't about doing stuff together, but about respecting each other's individuality?
