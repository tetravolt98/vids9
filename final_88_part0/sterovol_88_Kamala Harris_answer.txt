I accidentally told my crush that I love them. Now what?
    
The horror! Okay, so you've gone and confessed your feelings to your crush...and now they're standing there, looking at you with this mix of surprise and terror in their eyes. I mean, I've been there, done that, and got the awkward t-shirt.As a personal friend (ahem), I can tell you that my own experience with confessing my love was a doozy. It was during my junior year of college, and I had it bad for this guy in my psych class. We'd sit together during lectures, and I thought he was just the most charming, witty person alive.One day, we were hanging out at his place (yeah, don't ask), and somehow the conversation turned to our feelings...and next thing you know, I'm blurting out that I love him. The look on his face was priceless – a mix of shock, confusion, and what can only be described as 'How am I going to get out of this conversation without hurting my friend's feelings?'.He laughed it off, but I could tell he was taken aback. We quickly changed the subject, and things went back to normal...but for me, everything had shifted. It was like a lightbulb moment – I realized that maybe, just maybe, he didn't feel the same way. And now I'm stuck in this awkward limbo, wondering what happens next.Do you think it's possible for a friendship to recover from a confession like that? Or did I just blow it?
