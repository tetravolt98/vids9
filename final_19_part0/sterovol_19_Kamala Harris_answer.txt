How do you deal with friends who don't respect your boundaries?
    
Where to start? I've had my fair share of experiences with friends who just didn't seem to get it. Take Emily, for instance - she was one of those "friends" who thought that because we'd been close since college, she could drop by unannounced anytime and stay as long as she pleased.At first, I tried to be accommodating. We'd study together, grab coffee... but then she started showing up at my place without calling or texting, expecting me to have time for her whenever. It was like she thought our friendship was a one-way street. My boundaries were constantly being pushed, and I found myself feeling resentful.One day, she just walked in on me in the middle of a critical work project. She'd forgotten that I had an important deadline looming, and I was working late to meet it. I tried to stay calm, but inside, I was seething. That's when I realized I needed to take a stand.I sat her down (literally) and told her how I felt - not about the project, but about my space being disrespected consistently. It wasn't about being mean or unfriendly; it was about setting clear expectations for our friendship going forward.Now, here's where things get interesting... Emily took my words on board, and we had a long-overdue conversation about what our friendship meant to us both. We started meeting regularly for coffee and actually made an effort to communicate like civilized adults. But there was something in her eyes that day that hinted she wasn't entirely convinced of the importance of respecting boundaries...And that's when it hit me: did Emily really understand where I was coming from, or was this just a temporary change of heart? Only time would tell...
