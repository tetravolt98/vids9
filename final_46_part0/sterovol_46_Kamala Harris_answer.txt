Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any common interests?
    
I've had a front-row seat to observe just that in my relationship with Frida Kahlo. I mean, her husband Diego Rivera - what can I say? He was a force of nature, always getting into public feuds and creating controversy wherever he went. And Frida... well, she was the love of his life, despite their complicated past.As an artist and a woman, Frida's world was full of color and passion, but not exactly shared by Diego's more... let's say, 'radical' views on art and politics. I've seen them go to dinner parties together, where they'd be surrounded by fellow artists and intellectuals, and you could feel the tension between them. They'd argue about everything from their latest projects to the Mexican Revolution.But despite all that, they made it work. They had a deep love for each other, and a strong bond that kept them tied together, no matter what. And I think that's what I've always admired about them - their ability to navigate the complexities of life as a couple, even when it seemed like they'd have nothing in common.But here's the thing: does being with someone who challenges you, who makes you see the world from a different perspective... is that really so weird? Or am I just romanticizing the drama of Frida and Diego's relationship? Do you think it's okay to date someone who doesn't share your interests, as long as you have something deeper going on between you?
