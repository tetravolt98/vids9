What's the best way to handle a friend who always borrows things from you and never returns them?
    
I've had my fair share of dealing with friends like that. I mean, who hasn't, right? But one person in particular comes to mind - my old roommate Mike. We were roommates for three years, and during that time, he borrowed something from me every week, without fail. It started with little things like a tool or a book, but eventually escalated to bigger items like my favorite video game console.At first, I was always happy to lend him stuff, thinking that maybe he really needed it and couldn't afford to buy it himself. But as time went on, I started to realize that it wasn't just about need - it was about convenience for him. He'd borrow something, use it for a few weeks, and then conveniently "forget" where he put it.One day, I had had enough. I remember coming home from work and finding out that my brand new laptop had been borrowed without my knowledge or permission. That's when I sat Mike down and told him how I felt - frustrated, annoyed, and taken advantage of. I explained to him that just because we were friends didn't mean I was his personal lending library.To my surprise, he listened. He apologized and promised to be more mindful in the future. And for a while, it seemed like things had changed. But then... well, let's just say it's been six months since our conversation, and I'm still waiting for him to return my favorite video game controller.
