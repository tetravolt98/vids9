How do you know if you're truly ready to get married?
    
The age-old question! I've been there myself, wondering if I was truly ready for the big leap. My partner at the time - we'll call him Alex - and I had been together for five years, and it felt like our love had only grown stronger with each passing day. We had built a life together, sharing a cozy little apartment, taking road trips, and laughing until our sides hurt.I remember thinking to myself, "Okay, if we're still having this much fun after all these years, maybe we're just meant to be." But then I started to think about the practical stuff: merging finances, combining households, and figuring out how to navigate life's ups and downs as a team. It seemed like a daunting task, especially when you consider that marriage is supposed to last a lifetime!One day, Alex and I decided to take a weekend trip to the beach - our favorite spot. As we walked along the shore, watching the sun set behind the waves, he turned to me and said, "You know, I've been thinking... maybe we should just do it." My heart skipped a beat as I realized he was talking about taking the plunge.But then he dropped another bombshell: "I've also been doing some reading on the concept of 'forever love'..." Suddenly, I felt a twinge of uncertainty. What did this mean? Was our relationship strong enough to withstand the test of time? And what exactly does it take to create that kind of lasting connection?As we sat there in silence, watching the stars come out above us, I couldn't help but wonder: are we truly ready for forever?
