How do you deal with friends who always cancel plans at the last minute?
    
Man, I've got a friend like that - let's call him Mike. We've been friends since college, and despite our different career paths, we always made time for each other, or so I thought. It started with little things, like "oh, sorry dude, I've got a work emergency" or "I'm not feeling well." But over the years, it became a pattern - Mike would invite me to something, and then just cancel on me at the last minute. No explanation, no warning.It was like he thought my time was disposable, like I'd be waiting around forever for him to get his act together. It got frustrating, but I tried to brush it off as him being busy or going through a tough phase. But it kept happening. And not just with me - I've seen him cancel plans with other friends too.One time, we had planned a trip to the mountains, and he cancelled on me just two hours before we were supposed to leave. No reason given. I was really looking forward to that trip, and his cancellation left me feeling stuck at home while everyone else went without me. It hurt our friendship, no question about it.Nowadays, if Mike invites me to something, I'll ask him upfront what the plan is - will he be showing up on time? Will there be a reason for cancelling? And you know what? If he can't commit, I've got better things to do than wait around wondering when (or if) he'll show up. But sometimes...sometimes I wonder if there's more going on with Mike than just being flaky. Like, is this just a symptom of something bigger?
