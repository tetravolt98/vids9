What's the best way to handle a friend who always talks about their ex too much?
    
Let me tell you, I've been there with my friend Rachel and her constant oversharing about her latest breakup. At first, it was like she just needed someone to talk to, so I listened patiently and offered some sympathetic ear. But soon, it became an obsession - every time we hung out, she'd launch into a detailed account of her ex's latest transgressions or how he'd "broken" her heart.It got to the point where I felt like I was stuck in some kind of toxic relationship myself! I'd try to change the subject or excuse myself to grab another drink, but Rachel wouldn't take the hint. She just kept talking and talking...about him. It was like she thought I was fascinated by her ex's every move.One evening, as we were out at a bar with some other friends, I found myself zoning out during yet another lengthy tale about "Mr. Wrong." My friend Mike caught my eye and raised an eyebrow, like he'd noticed me checking out my watch for the umpteenth time that night. That's when it hit me: maybe Rachel wasn't just oversharing - maybe she was actually trying to get a reaction out of me.Was I right? Was Rachel using her ex-talk as some kind of twisted game to keep our friendship drama-filled and interesting? And if so, what did that say about our friendship in the first place...
