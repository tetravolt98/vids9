How do you know if you're truly happy with your current career path?
    
I'll never forget the conversation I had with Maya Angelou back in 2002 when she came to speak at my alma mater. We were sipping coffee and chatting about her latest book, "A Song Flung from the Heavens," in a quiet corner of the campus café. I was in my early twenties, trying to figure out if I was on the right path with my own writing career.She looked at me with those piercing eyes and said, "Child, happiness is not about being fulfilled; it's about being fully engaged." She told me that she used to think being a writer meant publishing novels, but for her, it meant telling stories that needed to be told. It was about living a life of purpose, even if it wasn't necessarily what others expected.I remember feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as I listened to her words. She was right – my passion for writing had always been driven by a desire to express myself, not just to succeed in the literary world. But the question still lingered: was I truly happy with my current career path? Was I doing what made me come alive?As Maya Angelou smiled and signed my copy of "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," I couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to the answer than just a simple yes or no. And now, years later, I'm still trying to figure out if my writing is truly making me come alive... do you think it's possible for someone to be happy with their career path without realizing it?
