What's the best way to handle a friend who always talks about their ex too much?
    
The eternal conundrum of the oversharing friend. I've been there with my own crew, and I can tell you that it's not just a minor annoyance – it's actually a delicate dance between being supportive and being tactfully honest.I recall when my close friend Emily (we'll call her that) broke up with her long-term boyfriend Alex. She was devastated, and rightfully so. But what started as a normal grieving process quickly turned into an obsession. Every. Single. Day. We'd be out grabbing coffee or trying new restaurants, and she'd spend the entire time dissecting every detail of their relationship – from the "cruel" way he ended things to the "betrayal" of his alleged infidelity.Now, I get it: you want your friends to feel heard, validated, and comforted during tough times. But with Emily, it started feeling like Groundhog Day. We'd have the same conversation every time we hung out – just different variations of "he was so mean," "she's such a drama queen," or "I'll never find love again." I loved her dearly, but it became hard to have genuine conversations without Alex coming up.So what did I do? Well, here's the thing: I talked to Emily about it. Not confrontationally, mind you – just genuinely curious and concerned. We had a heart-to-heart where I expressed my understanding of her pain but also how his constant presence in our conversations was making me feel like I couldn't connect with her on other topics.Her response surprised me (and actually, kind of helped me understand the dynamics better): she realized she'd been using their relationship as a way to avoid talking about other stuff – fears, insecurities, dreams... all the things that make us human. That revelation sparked an amazing conversation where we started exploring new topics together.Now, Emily still talks about Alex from time to time (a normal part of healing, after all). But I've learned how to respond in ways that keep our conversations balanced and fulfilling for both of us – without me feeling like I'm stuck in a toxic loop.
