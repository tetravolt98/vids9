How do you deal with friends who don't respect your opinions?
    
You know, I've had my fair share of experiences with that one - especially when it comes to my friends' fascination with Albert Einstein's life. One friend in particular, Alex, was obsessed with his theory of relativity. We were all at a dinner party once, and he just wouldn't let me finish a sentence about the concept without interrupting to "explain" it himself.I have to admit, I found myself getting frustrated - not just because he wasn't listening, but also because his explanations often deviated from the actual facts! As we continued to argue, our other friends started to take sides. It was turning into a full-blown debate, with Alex becoming more and more entrenched in his own understanding of Einstein's work.That's when I decided to try something different. Instead of trying to "win" the argument or prove my point, I asked Alex why he thought Einstein's theory was so groundbreaking. He launched into this passionate speech about how it changed the way we understand time and space - and suddenly, his enthusiasm was infectious! Our conversation transformed from a heated debate into a lively discussion.In that moment, I realized that maybe these "friend" debates weren't just about proving points, but about exploring ideas together. It made me wonder... what would happen if I started approaching disagreements with my friends in the same way? Would our relationships become stronger because of it?
