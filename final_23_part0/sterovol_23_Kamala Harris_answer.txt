How do you know if you're truly ready to get married?
    
Getting married is a big deal, trust me, I've been there. I was engaged for three years before finally walking down that aisle with my now-husband. But, looking back, I'm not sure if we were "ready" in the classical sense.What I mean is, we'd been together since college, and at first, it felt like a no-brainer. We knew each other inside out, had built a life together, and our love for each other only grew stronger with time. But, as the years went by, I started to feel this nagging sense that maybe we were just comfortable with each other – not necessarily in love.It wasn't until our wedding day that I realized what I truly felt. We'd planned a beautiful outdoor ceremony on a sunny June morning, and as I stood at the altar waiting for my groom to arrive, I remember feeling an overwhelming sense of excitement mixed with a dash of nervousness. And then he appeared, beaming from ear to ear, and it all just clicked into place.I realized that maybe we weren't just "ready" – maybe we'd already been ready in our own way, but hadn't realized it yet. We'd grown together through thick and thin, laughed and cried side by side... and now, finally, we were ready to take the leap and make a promise to each other.But here's the thing: looking back, I still wonder if we were truly "ready" or just comfortable with each other. What does it even mean to be "ready" for marriage? Is it just a matter of being in love, or is there something more to it?...
