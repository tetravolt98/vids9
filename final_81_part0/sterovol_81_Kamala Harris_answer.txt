What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever done to get out of doing something you didn't want to do?
    
Oh man, I'm still grinning just thinking about it. So, it was during my junior year in college, and I had a 10am lecture on Friday morning that I just couldn't face. I mean, who needs an 8am wake-up call when you can sleep until noon, right? But the thing is, my friend Alex was organizing this massive party in his dorm room, and it was going to be the ultimate bash of the semester – we're talking epic music, gallons of punch, and a guest list that rivaled the entire student body.Anyway, I knew if I showed up to that lecture, I'd be stuck inside while all my friends were living their best lives. So, in a moment of utter genius (or complete lunacy), I convinced myself that I had come down with a rare, highly contagious case of "Friday Fever" – it's a thing, trust me.I remember walking into the student health center, looking as pitiful as possible, and announcing to the nurse, "I've got it! It's like a combination of flu, food poisoning, and a bad hangover all at once." She looked at me skeptically, but I was prepared. I produced a fake prescription from my backpack (it just so happened to be scribbled on an old Starbucks napkin) that supposedly confirmed the diagnosis.To my surprise, she bought it! She poked me with some thermometers, asked a few questions, and then proceeded to give me a stern warning about self-diagnosing illnesses. I left the health center feeling like a total boss, only to find out later that Alex had actually been working on a group project during the party... and our team got an A minus because of it!
