I accidentally sent my crush a text meant for someone else. What do I do now?
    
The horror! I've been in your shoes before. Okay, so let's talk about this. It was like three years ago when I accidentally sent a funny joke to the love of my life - Emma Taylor - while I meant to send it to my best friend Mike. I was in a rush to get out of the house and I must have grabbed her name by mistake.At first, I thought the worst. I imagined all sorts of scenarios where she would think I was some kind of weirdo or that I had feelings for her beyond friendship. But then something unexpected happened - she texted me back! And not only did she respond, but we ended up having this hilarious conversation about how my joke made no sense in the context of our conversation.But here's the thing: it didn't end there. Emma actually brought it up with me later that day, and I was mortified. I thought for sure I'd blown it and ruined any chance of us ever being more than friends. But to my surprise, she just laughed and said something like, "Dude, you're such a goofball." And then...she asked me if I wanted to go get coffee with her!Now, I'm not saying this is exactly what happened in your case, but the point is - accidents happen! The question now is: will you take the plunge and see where things go? Will you grab that coffee or will you play it safe and hope she never finds out?
