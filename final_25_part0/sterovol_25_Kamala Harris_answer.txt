What's the most memorable date night experience you've ever had?
    
I'll never forget that evening I took my partner to see David Bowie at Wembley Stadium in 1990. We'd been waiting for what felt like an eternity to see him live, and finally, the day arrived.As we made our way through the crowds, you could feel the excitement building. My partner was bouncing with anticipation, and I couldn't help but match their energy. We found our spot near the stage, and just as the opening chords of "Space Oddity" started playing, the lights went down, and David Bowie emerged from the darkness.He was even more mesmerizing live than in his music videos – the way he moved across the stage with a confident swagger, his voice soaring through the lyrics. We sang along to every song, hands locked together, completely absorbed in the performance. It was like nothing I'd ever experienced before.At one point, Bowie launched into an impromptu rendition of "Heroes," and the crowd erupted into cheers. The energy was electric – people were crying, hugging each other, and screaming for more. My partner turned to me with tears in their eyes, and I knew that this moment would stay with us forever.But what happened next still has me wondering... As we made our way out of the stadium, hand in hand, we stumbled upon David Bowie himself – he'd come offstage and was mingling with fans. My partner's eyes widened as they grabbed my arm, whispering "do you think I could talk to him?" Do you think anyone can resist the temptation of meeting a music icon?
