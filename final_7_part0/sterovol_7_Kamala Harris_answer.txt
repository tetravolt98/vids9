Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my friend got fired from their job?
    
I can definitely relate to this one - I'm thinking of the time I had with Vincent van Gogh. I wasn't exactly his friend, but I was his confidant, or at least that's what he thought. Anyway, we were living in Arles, and he'd just received some bad news from his brother Theo back in Holland. The letter said that his latest batch of paintings had been rejected by a certain art dealer, and let me tell you, Vincent was devastated.At first, I tried to be understanding - I listened to him rant about the injustice of it all, and I even offered some words of encouragement. But as time went on, he just got more and more withdrawn. He'd spend hours pacing around his room, muttering to himself, and I could see the desperation in his eyes.Now, looking back, I realize that my friend's situation wasn't exactly parallel to Vincent's - they'd simply gotten fired from their job, not had their artistic dreams shattered. But at the same time...I mean, have you ever been let go? It's a crappy feeling, no matter what your friends or family say.So was I the jerk for not being more understanding? Maybe. I don't know. All I do know is that it's hard to be in someone else's shoes when we're still trying to figure out our own. And sometimes, even with the best of intentions...we just can't quite get it right.And speaking of getting it right - did your friend ever find a new job?
