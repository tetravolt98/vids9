Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any outside hobbies together?
    
I had a friend in college who was one of those perfect couples - you know, the kind that seemed to be made for each other. They were both business majors, and their friends would often joke that they were married...to their textbooks. But what struck me as weird wasn't even that they didn't have outside hobbies together - it was how into themselves they got.I remember this one night we all went out to a concert, and my friend's girlfriend was glued to her phone the whole time, texting away while her boyfriend was busy trying to get everyone in our group to join him for a pre-game pint. I thought it was cute at first, but as the night wore on, I started to notice how little they interacted with each other.And don't even get me started on their social media - they were always posting these perfect couple selfies, but you'd never see them actually doing anything together in public. It was like they were competing in some sort of online popularity contest rather than being a real team.But what really got to me was when I asked my friend if he ever felt weird not having any outside hobbies with his girlfriend...or if they even did things just for themselves anymore. He looked at me kinda defensively and said, "What's the point? We're happy together." And yeah, on the surface, it seemed like they were - but what does 'happily' mean to you when you're not actually doing anything together?Now I'm left wondering...is that really enough for a healthy relationship?
