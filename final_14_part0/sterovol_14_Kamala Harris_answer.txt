Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when friends don't have any photos of themselves with their significant others?
    
I've got a story that might make you feel better - or worse. Let me tell you, it's about my friend Rachel and her boyfriend Mike. They're one of those couples who are always together, but somehow never seem to capture the moment on camera.It wasn't until I pointed out to Rachel that she had no photos with Mike from their entire relationship that we started to notice a pattern. Every time they'd go on vacation or just hang out at home, they'd be inseparable - except for when someone would pull out their phone to take a group photo. Then, and only then, would they suddenly find themselves with their arms around each other's waists.I'd often joke that Mike was the ultimate "camera-shy" boyfriend, but deep down, I wondered if there was more to it than just being shy. One day, Rachel finally confessed to me that she and Mike had a long-standing agreement - no photos unless they were in front of a beautiful sunset or a stunning mountain range. Apparently, he felt self-conscious about their "real life" moments, and she'd humored him for years.But the real question is... have you ever wondered what secrets your friends might be hiding behind those carefully curated social media posts? I mean, what if Mike wasn't just camera-shy, but actually had a secret to keep?
