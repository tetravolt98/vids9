What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever done to get out of doing something you didn't want to do?
    
Oh man, I'm still cringing thinking about it... So, I must have been around 15 or 16 at the time. My family had just moved to a new house in the suburbs, and my parents were trying to get me to join the local school's drama club. I was not interested – I hated acting and singing, and just wanted to spend my free time playing video games or riding my skateboard.But my parents wouldn't take no for an answer, as usual. They thought it would be "good for me" to try out some new thing and meet new people... Yeah, right. So, I came up with a pretty ridiculous plan.I told them that I was convinced I had a rare genetic condition where I couldn't perform in front of more than three people at a time – yeah, it sounds crazy now, but I was desperate! I made up this whole story about how my doctor had said I would break out in embarrassing dance moves if I tried to act in front of an audience larger than three.My parents were completely taken in by me. They thought it was the most legitimate-sounding excuse ever (I mean, who wouldn't be worried about their kid breaking into spontaneous dance?), and they actually went along with my "condition." They even made up this elaborate backstory about how I had to wear special earplugs to protect myself from the "disease" – yeah, it was ridiculous.But here's the thing... I'm not sure if I completely fooled them. My mom still gives me this knowing look sometimes, like she knows exactly what I did. And now I'm wondering... what if she actually does know?
