How do you deal with friends who don't respect your opinions?
    
I still remember my college days when I was part of a study group with some close friends. We would often discuss politics and social issues, and I recall having heated debates with one friend in particular, Alex. He was always quick to dismiss my views, even when I presented solid arguments. At first, I tried to brush it off and assume he just disagreed without being disagreeable.But as time went on, I realized that his behavior wasn't just a difference of opinion – it was a pattern. He would interrupt me mid-sentence, roll his eyes, and sometimes even laugh in my face when I presented an idea. It felt like he wasn't taking me seriously, or worse, not valuing my thoughts at all.One day, I decided to confront him about it. We were discussing a contentious topic, and I calmly pointed out that his behavior was making me feel disrespected. To my surprise, Alex got defensive and accused me of being too sensitive. That's when I realized that he wasn't even acknowledging the issue – let alone trying to understand why it bothered me.I walked away from the conversation feeling frustrated and a bit hurt. It made me wonder if this was someone I could continue to call a friend. And now, years later, I still haven't figured out how to navigate friendships where my opinions aren't valued...
