What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever done to get out of doing something you didn't want to do?
    
Oh man, I'm still cringing thinking about it... So, it was during my junior year of high school, and our teacher, Mrs. Johnson, announced that we'd be performing in the school's annual talent show. Now, I've never been exactly what you'd call a "performer," and the thought of getting up in front of the whole school made me want to crawl under a rock.But here's the thing: my best friend since childhood, Alex, had somehow convinced me that we should perform together – just the two of us. I think he was trying to boost his own confidence (and, let's be real, also get out of participating). Anyway, I reluctantly agreed, thinking it would be a quick fix and then we could bail.But as the talent show got closer, Alex started coming up with these ridiculous song ideas – like, seriously outlandish stuff. I remember one time he showed me his lyrics for our "performance," which included singing about our love for pizza... while wearing matching chicken costumes. Yeah, it was that bad.The day of the talent show arrived, and we were frantically rehearsing backstage (well, Alex was rehearsing; I was panicking). Just as we were about to go on, Mrs. Johnson came over and asked if we had a special announcement or something to share with everyone... And that's when Alex turned to me with this crazy glint in his eye and whispered: "We're going to recite the entire script of 'Hamlet' – but backwards!"
