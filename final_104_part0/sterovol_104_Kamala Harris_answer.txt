I accidentally told my crush that I love them. Now what?
    
The agonizing terror of putting your heart on your sleeve only to watch it splatter all over the floor! I'm speaking from personal experience here, as I once made the same mistake with a certain someone... (coughs, trying to composed myself)Okay, so you told them. And now? Well, let me tell you, it's like that moment when you realize you've just spilled your favorite coffee all over your new white shirt – it's a catastrophe! But, as I recall from my own experience, the key is to not panic (which I, unfortunately, didn't do).As soon as the words left my lips, I knew I'd made a mistake. My heart was racing like a jackrabbit on Red Bull, and my face must have been beet-red because... well, because I'm pretty sure I turned into a tomato right then and there! But still, I had to play it cool, right? So, I took a deep breath (or tried to – it's hard when your lungs are doing the cha-cha-slide) and waited for their response.Which brings me to the crucial question: what if they feel the same way?! What if you've just opened up the doors to something amazing? But, equally possible, what if they don't feel the same... and now you're stuck in this awkward limbo of 'I told them I love them'?So, here's my advice (which, keep in mind, might not exactly be a reliable source, given my own questionable judgment): take it as an opportunity to learn more about each other. Have a conversation – a real one, not just some superficial chat to fill the awkward silence. Be vulnerable, be honest... and see where it takes you! But, if I'm being completely honest (which I try not to be when it comes to my love life)... there's still so much uncertainty ahead! What will they say? Will you get a second chance?
