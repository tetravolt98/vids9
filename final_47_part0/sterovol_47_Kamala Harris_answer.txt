How do you know if you're truly happy with your current career path?
    
You know, I've been thinking a lot about this lately because I'm in a bit of a transition phase myself. I've always assumed that by my mid-twenties, I'd have my life together – a stable job, a loving relationship, and all the usual adulting stuff figured out.But here's the thing: I've been working as a graphic designer for the past three years, and while it's not terrible, I find myself daydreaming about doing something more... creative. Not just designing logos and brochures, but making art that truly speaks to me.It started with little things – doodling on my notebook during meetings, experimenting with watercolor painting in my free time. But as the moments kept piling up, I realized I was feeling stifled by the 9-to-5 grind. My passion for design wasn't just a hobby anymore; it was a genuine calling.So, how do you know if you're truly happy? For me, it's about listening to that nagging voice in my head. Am I constantly daydreaming about something else? Do I feel like I'm putting on a mask every time I go into work?It's funny – the more I think about leaving my job, the more people tell me I'm being "irresponsible." That I should just focus on making a steady income and then pursue my dreams later. But what if that 'later' never comes? What if the fear of uncertainty becomes too overwhelming to ignore?I've started toying with the idea of taking a leap – maybe starting my own design studio, or even quitting altogether to explore other passions (writing, photography... who knows?). The scariest part is imagining the possibility of failure. But what's scarier? Regretting it for the rest of your life because you didn't take that chance?That's where I am right now – weighing my options and trying not to let fear dictate my decisions. What about you?
