What's the best way to handle a friend who always talks about their ex too much?
    
I still remember my own experience with that very issue, back in college when I was close friends with Emily. She had just broken up with her long-time boyfriend, Alex, and it seemed like no matter how hard we tried to get her mind off him, he was always the topic of conversation.At first, I was sympathetic - who doesn't love a good venting session? But as weeks went by and every social gathering turned into an opportunity for Emily to dissect their relationship, I started to feel like I was stuck in some sort of toxic loop. We'd go out with our group, have a great time, and then suddenly Alex would be brought up again - the "incident" that led to the breakup, the way he always seemed so unhappy, or his supposedly questionable character traits.I tried being supportive, asking open-ended questions like "What happened this week?" or "How are you feeling about everything?" But somehow, those attempts only seemed to fuel her nostalgia. I felt like I was walking on eggshells around Emily, never quite sure what would set her off again. Her ex was like a perpetual specter, looming over our friendships and suffocating the rest of us with his presence.One day, as we were hanging out at my place, Emily started reminiscing about Alex's favorite coffee spot - you know, the one where they always used to grab their morning lattes together? And I just sort of... snapped. Okay, maybe "snapped" is too strong, but I did say something like, "Emily, honestly? Can we please not talk about him for the rest of our lives?" It was like a dam had broken, and suddenly all this built-up frustration came pouring out.Now, Emily just gave me that look - you know, the one where you're trying to figure out what's wrong with your friend but also feeling a little defensive. And I'm still not sure how things will shake out between us...
