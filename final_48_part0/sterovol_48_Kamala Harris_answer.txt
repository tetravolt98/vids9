I accidentally sent my crush a video meant for someone else. What do I do now?
    
Oh man, I can totally relate to this situation! You know who I'm thinking of right now? Leonardo DiCaprio. Yeah, that's right - L-Dub himself.I was at a film festival once and I met him in the green room before his Q&A session. I was starstruck (obviously), but trying to play it cool. We started talking about this documentary he was working on, and I must have gotten distracted because next thing I know, I accidentally sent him a video of me messing around with a friend from my phone.I died inside. I mean, what was I thinking?! It wasn't even a good video! Just me making silly faces and trying to get my friend to laugh. I was mortified. But Leo just smiled and said, "Hey, no worries, kid. We've all been there." And that's it. He didn't even ask for an explanation.But here's the thing: that conversation actually ended up being a great opportunity for me. After we talked about his film, he asked if I had any questions for him. And since I was so nervous and flustered from sending him the video, I couldn't think of anything to say... except to ask him how he handled embarrassing moments like mine.Now, that's where things got really interesting. He leaned in and said, "Well, let me tell you a secret..."
