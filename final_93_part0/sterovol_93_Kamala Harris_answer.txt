What's the best way to handle a friend who always talks about their ex too much?
    
Where do I even start with this one? So, I've got a friend - let's call her Sarah - and she's been going through a tough breakup for months now. At first, I was all ears, like any good friend would be. But as the weeks went by, it started to feel like Groundhog Day all over again. Same stories, same tears, same "he didn't understand me" conversations... day in, day out.Now, I'm not one to jump into mediating relationships or telling people what they want to hear (I've got enough drama in my own life, thank you very much!), but there comes a point when it's like, okay, girl, we get it. You're hurt. But can we talk about something else for 5 minutes?So, I tried talking to her about it - nicely, of course! I was like, "Hey, Sarah, I love you and I'm here for you, but maybe let's take a break from the ex-talk every now and then? You know, explore some new topics?" But she just got defensive and said I wasn't listening to her.Here's the thing: as friends, we want to be supportive and listen, but sometimes that means knowing when to hold our tongues or say, "Actually, can we talk about something else?" It's not about dismissing their feelings or minimizing their pain - it's just about finding a healthy balance. And honestly? I'm still trying to figure out how to handle this one with Sarah...
