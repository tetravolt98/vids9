Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my partner had to take a break from me because they were stressed?
    
The infamous time with Frida Kahlo in Mexico City. I was lucky enough to have met her at a local art studio, where she was working on some of her most iconic pieces. Her energy was palpable, but also... intense.As I got to know her, I realized that her life had been marked by physical and emotional pain, and that stress and anxiety were constant companions. But even with all that on her plate, Frida had this incredible capacity for love and connection.One day, she confided in me that she was feeling overwhelmed, not just physically but also emotionally. She needed some space to recharge, to paint and collect herself before coming back to our conversations. I remember feeling a bit frustrated at first – after all, I wanted to talk to her, to spend time with her! But then I realized that this was a moment of great vulnerability for her.I chose not to take offense or get defensive, instead offering my support and understanding. And you know what? It ended up being one of the most intimate moments we shared. She opened up to me in ways she wouldn't have if I'd pushed back against her need for space. I asked myself then – just as you're asking now – "Am I the jerk, or am I showing empathy?"
