How do you deal with friends who don't respect your opinions?
    
I've had my fair share of run-ins with friends like that, particularly when I was a teenager and just starting to form my own ideas about social justice. There was this one friend, Alex, who was always so quick to shoot down my opinions on politics and activism. She'd get defensive whenever I tried to express myself, and it would escalate into these heated arguments.One time, we were discussing the Black Lives Matter movement in class, and I shared some insights from a book that had really resonated with me. Alex cut me off mid-sentence, saying something like, "Oh, you think you're so smart just because you read one book?" I was taken aback by her tone – it felt condescending and dismissive.I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe she didn't mean to hurt my feelings. But as the days went by, I realized that this wasn't a one-time thing. Every time I tried to share my thoughts on something important, Alex would interrupt or belittle me. It was like my opinions weren't even worth considering.It got to the point where I started questioning whether we were really friends at all. I began to wonder if she only tolerated me because we went to the same school and hung out in the same social circle. It made me feel small and insignificant, like my voice didn't matter.I'm still not sure how to deal with friends like that – it's a constant struggle to find a balance between standing up for myself and not wanting to rock the boat. I guess what I've learned is that true friends will respect your opinions, even if they disagree with them... but then again, there was this one time when Alex actually surprised me by listening to my thoughts without interrupting...
