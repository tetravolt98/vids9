Am I the jerk for thinking my coworker is secretly in love with me, even though they say we're just friends?
    
I've been there too. I mean, you think of David Bowie as a rockstar, but to me, he's the guy who worked down the hall from me at the BBC radio station where I was an intern back in the late '70s.Let me tell you, that guy had charisma oozing out of every pore. And it wasn't just his music - although, let's be real, that's what made him a rockstar. It was this... this presence he had. Like, when he walked into a room, everyone's eyes would go to him, and you couldn't help but be drawn in.And now, I'm not saying your coworker is David Bowie, but... okay, fine, maybe I am. But seriously, it's not like they've ever given me any reason to think otherwise - we're just friends, right? So why do I get this feeling that there's something more?It started when we were working on a project together and he'd catch my eye across the room, just for a split second. Nothing major, but enough to make me wonder if maybe... possibly... he was trying to tell me something. And then there are these little moments where he'll lean in close while talking to me, his voice low and conspiratorial... it's like he's sharing some secret that only we know.I'm not saying I've got proof or anything - just a nagging feeling that there might be more to this friendship than meets the eye. And honestly? It's driving me a little crazy. Am I just being paranoid, or is there something more going on here?
