Am I the jerk for thinking my coworker is secretly in love with me, even though they say we're just friends?
    
I've had a situation like that before, and it's still a bit of a puzzle to me. My coworker at the time was this charismatic woman named Sophie - she was one of those people who could light up a room with her presence. We worked together in marketing, and we would often collaborate on projects, bouncing ideas off each other.At first, I thought nothing of it; we were just colleagues, after all. But then I started to notice little things that made me think there might be more to our relationship than met the eye. Like how she would linger around my desk a bit too long, chatting with me about everything and nothing. Or how she'd bring me coffee in the morning, always knowing exactly how I take it.Now, I know what you're thinking - maybe I'm just reading too much into things. But here's the thing: Sophie never once tried to hide her feelings or brush off my interpretations of our dynamic. In fact, when I asked her directly if she had feelings for me, she laughed and said we were just friends.That was... telling. I mean, who laughs like that? Maybe it was just a nervous smile, but in that moment, I wasn't so sure. And now I'm left wondering: am I being paranoid, or is Sophie playing some kind of game with me?What do you think - can people really be oblivious to the way others perceive their behavior, or is there always an ulterior motive at play?
