Am I the jerk for thinking my coworker is secretly in love with me, even though they say we're just friends?
    
The infamous "co-worker crush" conundrum. I've been there, done that, and got the t-shirt... or should I say, the awkward office rendezvous.Let me tell you, I was once convinced that my coworker, Alex, was secretly pining for me. We'd work together on projects, exchange banter over lunch, and even commiserate about our shared love of coffee. To me, it seemed like more than just a friendly dynamic. But every time I brought up the topic, Alex would brush it off with a laugh and say we were "just friends."I remember one day, we were working late on a particularly tricky project. The office was empty, and the tension between us was palpable. I started to wonder if maybe, just maybe, Alex was feeling what I was feeling. But then they asked me for help with their cat's vet appointment... yeah, that didn't exactly scream "romantic interest."Fast-forward a few weeks, and I'm still unsure about Alex's true feelings. Were we really just friends, or was there something more beneath the surface? The uncertainty was driving me crazy.Now, I know what you're thinking: am I being a jerk for assuming this in the first place? Honestly, maybe a little. But at the same time, don't all of us wonder about these things sometimes? It's the not knowing that gets to me...
