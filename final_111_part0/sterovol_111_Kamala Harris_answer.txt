How do you know if you're truly happy with your current career path?
    
I still remember the conversation I had with a close friend who's a renowned photographer. We were sitting in her studio, surrounded by her beautiful work on display, and she was asking me about my job as a journalist. At first, I thought it was just small talk, but then she asked me that exact question: "Do you know if you're truly happy with your current career path?"I have to admit, it made me pause for a moment. As a journalist, I've had the opportunity to cover some incredible stories and meet amazing people. But lately, I'd been feeling unfulfilled – like there was something missing. So, I started thinking about all the things that brought me joy, like writing and storytelling, but also my passion for social justice.As I looked around her studio, I noticed a photo exhibition she had curated on environmental issues. It sparked an idea in me. Maybe, just maybe, it's time to pivot from journalism to photography, using my skills to tell the stories that really matter to me – like climate change and sustainability.That conversation with my friend made me realize that true happiness comes from pursuing your passions and values, not just a job title or career path. But here's the thing: I've always been afraid of taking the leap, fearing failure and uncertainty. So, as I sat there with her, looking at all those incredible photographs...I couldn't help but wonder: what if I took that leap? What would happen?
