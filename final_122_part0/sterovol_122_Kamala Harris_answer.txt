Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my friend got into a fight with someone online?
    
I've been there too, wondering if we're being unreasonable in our expectations of others. I'm going to give you a personal perspective on this, since I had a similar experience with... well, let's just say it involved none other than the great Nikola Tesla.I was working as an intern at the Tesla Museum back in my college days, and one of my colleagues, Alex, got into a heated debate with a fellow online enthusiast over some obscure details about Tesla's work on alternating current. The discussion quickly escalated into a full-blown online spat, with both sides trading insults and accusations.As I watched from the sidelines, I felt myself getting increasingly frustrated with Alex for not being more level-headed in his responses. Why was he taking it so seriously? Couldn't he just let it go? But then something struck me. As I looked through old archives of Tesla's letters and notebooks, I realized that the great inventor himself had faced similar ridicule and backlash during his time.Tesla's contemporaries didn't understand his revolutionary ideas, and they mocked him mercilessly. Yet, he persevered, driven by a fierce passion for his work. When I saw Alex's determination to stand up for what he believed in, despite the online criticism, it hit me: maybe we're not being jerks at all. Maybe we're just... being like Tesla.But here's the thing: where do you draw the line between standing up for yourself and fueling the fire? That's a question I still grapple with to this day...
