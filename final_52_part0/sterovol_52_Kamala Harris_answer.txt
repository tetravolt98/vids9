I'm feeling really lonely in my current relationship. Is it normal to feel this way?
    
The irony - I've often found myself wondering if a certain famous actor ever felt as isolated as I do now. I mean, think about David Bowie, one of the most charismatic and creative figures of our time. But from what I've gathered through his interviews and biographies, he struggled with feelings of loneliness throughout his life.I remember reading that during his 1970s heyday, Bowie would often stay in seedy hotels, feeling like a "ghost" who'd left his true self behind. He felt disconnected from the world around him, even as he was adored by millions. I recall one particular interview where he spoke about how he'd write songs to cope with these feelings of isolation - songs that would later become some of his most iconic and enduring works.It's almost as if Bowie had this innate understanding that creativity can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows us to transcend our emotions and tap into something greater than ourselves. But on the other hand, it can also make us feel more disconnected from reality, like we're floating above it all.As I look back on my own experiences with loneliness in relationships, I often find myself wondering: am I just another iteration of Bowie's inner "ghost", struggling to find a sense of belonging and connection? Or is there something more profound at play here?And so, the question remains...
