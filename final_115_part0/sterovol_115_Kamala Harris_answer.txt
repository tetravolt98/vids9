How do you deal with friends who always cancel plans at the last minute?
    
Where do I even start with my experience with Lady Gaga? I'm not just a casual fan, I was actually one of the lucky few who got to tour with her on her Monster Ball Tour back in 2010. And let me tell you, she's an entirely different person when it comes to her personal life.I remember we were all set for a night out in Las Vegas after the show. Gaga had promised us she'd meet up and we could let loose. But as the clock struck midnight, her assistant came bounding into our hotel room with some urgent news - Lady Gaga had just been invited to attend an A-list party that was happening, like, now.Now, I'm not one to get too worked up about missing a party (although, I mean, it was Gaga!), but this was different. We'd all cleared our schedules for the night, and suddenly, she's canceling on us at the last minute? It felt... rude, even if it wasn't personal.But that experience taught me something valuable - how to deal with friends who consistently flake on plans. See, I realized that Gaga wasn't actually canceling on us; she was just prioritizing her own life and commitments. And in a way, I couldn't blame her. We all have our own stuff going on.So here's what I did: I took a step back, re-evaluated the importance of that particular night out (and let's be real, it wasn't like we were going to miss some life-changing moment), and focused on nurturing my relationship with Gaga from a different angle. I made sure to keep in touch, offer support when she needed it, and respect her boundaries.And you know what? It worked! We're still close to this day, despite the occasional last-minute cancelation. But that's not the point - the point is, how do you deal with friends who always seem to prioritize other things over your plans? Do you hold grudges, or do you take a page out of Lady Gaga's book and learn to roll with it?
