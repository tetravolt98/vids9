Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any common interests?
    
I've had a front-row seat to the world of celebrity relationships, courtesy of my job as an assistant on a popular talk show. And let me tell you, I've seen some interesting dynamics play out between stars.Take, for example, the time I worked with Leonardo DiCaprio and his then-girlfriend, Camila Morrone. Now, don't get me wrong, Leo's a great guy and all that, but they just seemed...different. They'd show up to work together, and it was like two completely separate people were arriving on set each day. One minute he'd be passionately discussing environmental issues with his team, the next she'd be giggling with her friends about some TV show I'd never heard of.It wasn't until I overheard their conversation in a quiet moment that things started to click for me. Camila was telling Leo about this new podcast she'd discovered, and he just looked at her like...well, like a puzzled puppy. I swear, the guy's face contorted into this hilarious expression, as if he had no idea what she was talking about.And yet, despite their seemingly disparate interests, they seemed to genuinely enjoy each other's company. It made me wonder: do you really need to share common interests with your partner? Or is it enough just to have a deep connection and respect for one another?But then I saw them break up after a few years together...and that's when things got really interesting.
