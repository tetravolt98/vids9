I accidentally told my crush that I love them. Now what?
    
The horror! I've been there too. Okay, so it's not exactly like when I confessed to Michael Jackson that I loved him (long story, don't ask), but close enough.So, you blurted out the L-word to your crush. First things first, take a deep breath and try not to freak out. I know it's easier said than done, trust me. My palms were sweating just thinking about what I was going to do next.As soon as the words escaped my mouth, I regretted them. The anticipation of their response was killing me – would they laugh, get annoyed, or actually feel the same way? The silence that followed was deafening. It felt like an eternity before they finally spoke up.That's when it hit me: you can't take back what you've said, but you can own it. I decided to face my fear and see how they'd react. Would they reciprocate your feelings or would this be a total disaster? The uncertainty was almost unbearable.Here's where the story takes an interesting turn... As I waited for their response, I started thinking about all the what-ifs. What if they feel the same way? What if they don't care either way? And then it hit me – what if they're not even interested in you romantically? The thought sent a shiver down my spine.Now I'm left wondering: how will your crush respond? Will they confess their own feelings or try to brush off yours? Do you take the risk and see where this goes, or play it safe and pretend nothing happened? Only time (and a lot of courage) will tell...
