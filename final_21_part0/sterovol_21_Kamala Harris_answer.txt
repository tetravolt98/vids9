What's the best way to handle a friend who always borrows money from you and never pays back?
    
The infamous Leonardo DiCaprio. I've had the privilege of calling him a friend for over a decade, and let me tell you, it's been a wild ride. But one thing that's consistently driven me nuts is his habit of borrowing money from me and then... well, not exactly "forgetting" to pay me back, but more like, putting it on the backburner.It started innocently enough – he'd ask for a loan to cover some unexpected expense or to fund a new project. And I'd happily oblige, because, let's be honest, who wouldn't want to help out their buddy Leo? But over time, these loans began to add up. Like, seriously add up. I'm talking tens of thousands of dollars worth of "favors" that he just can't seem to repay.Now, I know what you're thinking – "Just set boundaries, right?" Easy for you to say! This is Leonardo DiCaprio we're talking about. He's a global superstar with more money than most small countries. It's not like I'm some cash-strapped college student who can just tell him to pay up or else.But despite my best efforts to remain patient and understanding, the situation has started to get... interesting. There was that one time when he asked me for an "emergency loan" to cover some film production costs, only to have me discover later that he'd actually used the money to fund his own side project – a documentary about whales, no less! (I kid you not.)So here's where I'm at now: I've cut him off, but deep down, I still care for the guy. And yet... and yet... I have this nagging feeling that he's going to need me again soon. Like, really soon. The question is, will I be able to resist his charms and stick to my guns? Only time – and possibly a few more loans – will tell!
