What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever done to get out of doing something you didn't want to do?
    
.. I'd have to say it was during my internship at a marketing firm when I was assigned to work on a project with our company's founder, Steve Jobs' biographer. He was notoriously tough to please and had this reputation for being...let's just say, very demanding.Anyway, I had been dreading the project from day one because it required me to write a 10-page report on the history of advertising in Silicon Valley. Now, I'm not exactly what you'd call an "expert" on that subject (or any subject, really). But hey, at least it was better than doing actual work, right?So, I convinced my colleague – and mutual friend – Michael to join me for a "research trip" to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. We spent the whole day playing video games and eating pizza while pretending to do research (okay, fine, we actually did do some research... sort of).The next morning, we presented our findings to the biographer... or at least, what we claimed were our findings. He was completely taken in by our "insights" on how Steve Jobs had revolutionized advertising with his innovative use of... well, it's a long story.As we left the meeting room, Michael turns to me and says, "Dude, I think we just got out of actually doing work!" I just grinned and said, "Told you it was a genius plan!"But, here's the thing: did we really get away with it? I mean, how long will it take him to figure out that our report is basically a bunch of fluff...
