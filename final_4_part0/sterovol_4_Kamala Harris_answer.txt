What's the craziest thing you've ever done on a dare?
    
I'm still trying to convince my friends that I actually did this... Okay, so it was during our senior year of high school. We were all hanging out in the park on a crisp autumn afternoon, and my friend Alex dared me to sing "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor in front of the entire student body at the next day's lunchtime.Now, I know what you're thinking - it's just a silly song, how bad could it be? But let me tell you, that's a karaoke nightmare for most people. And I'm not exactly known for my singing voice... or should I say, lack thereof? My friends were all cheering me on, saying I'd be the next American Idol (yeah, right), and Alex was offering to buy me a year's supply of vocal lessons if I actually did it.So, with a healthy dose of nervousness and a pinch of madness, I agreed. We snuck into the lunchroom early in the morning and set up the mic, trying not to draw attention from the cafeteria staff. The next day at lunchtime, Alex gives me this big grin, whispers "you're on!" in my ear, and I'm supposed to belt out the song for everyone to hear.That's when things got weird... As I take a deep breath and start singing, something strange happens - people start clapping along! And not just anyone, mind you. The school's notoriously tough drama teacher, Mrs. Thompson, is tapping her foot with an approving smile on her face. The whole cafeteria erupts in cheers and whistles by the time I hit the chorus... only to freeze mid-sentence as the principal walks in and gives me this stern look, saying something about "unofficial talent show"...
