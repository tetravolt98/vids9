Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my friend got into a fight with someone online?
    
I've had that exact same conundrum with none other than Elon Musk. We were all set to go on his SpaceX's first commercial flight, and as you can imagine, it was a big deal. I mean, who wouldn't want to be one of the first civilians in space?But just a few days before launch, Musk tweeted some pretty... incendiary stuff about another company. Long story short, my friend, who's actually an amazing software engineer, got into a heated online exchange with a fan of that other company. Let's just say things escalated quickly.As the drama unfolded, I found myself torn between being supportive and wanting to tell my friend to calm down. I mean, we're all about innovation and pushing boundaries on this team, right? But at the same time, you can't help but wonder if it's really worth getting into a fight over.The thing is, Musk himself got involved in the online spat, and before I knew it, he'd invited my friend to join him for a private chat about... well, I'm not entirely sure what they talked about. All I know is that it was pretty intense, and I had to ask myself: am I being too understanding by letting my friend get swept up in all this? Or are we just letting our emotions get the better of us?I'm still trying to figure that out... but one thing's for sure â€“ it's not always easy to know what the right response is when your friends and idols collide with controversy online.
