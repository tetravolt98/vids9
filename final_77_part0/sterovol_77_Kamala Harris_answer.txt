What's the best way to handle a friend who always talks about their ex too much?
    
I've had my fair share of dealing with that exact situation, thanks to my good friend Emily. We were in our early twenties when her on-again, off-again relationship with Mike finally came to an end. I was there for the whole drama-filled ride, and at first, it was all about me being supportive and listening to her vent.But as time went on, I started to notice that every conversation we had - whether we were grabbing coffee or just hanging out at home - would inevitably steer back to Mike. It wasn't just the occasional mention; Emily's obsession with their relationship was becoming a full-blown pattern. She'd spend hours dissecting their interactions, wondering what he meant by this or that, and even going as far as analyzing his social media posts.It got to the point where I felt like I was stuck in some kind of toxic loop. I didn't want to hurt her feelings or dismiss her emotions, but at the same time, I couldn't help but feel suffocated by all this Mike-talk. So, one day, as we were discussing our plans for a weekend getaway, I decided to take a deep breath and say something."Hey, Emily? Can we not talk about Mike today?" I asked, trying to sound lighthearted but firm. "I love you, but sometimes it feels like you're still in that relationship with him, even though he's long gone."Her expression changed in an instant - from hurt and defensive to introspective and contemplative. She looked at me with this weird mix of gratitude and realization... and I swear, I thought I saw a spark of "aha" flicker across her face. But just as things were starting to get interesting..."You know what?" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I think you might be right."
