What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever lied about to avoid hurting someone's feelings?
    
I'm not proud of this story, but I have to share it. It was during my college days, and I had just started dating a girl named Rachel. She was sweet, but also super into her favorite singer, Justin Bieber (yes, you read that right). Anyway, she asked me if I had seen him in concert before, and I panicked. I mean, who wants to admit they've never been to a Bieb's show?So, I lied and told her that I'd actually met him backstage at a concert once. I know, I know, it was ridiculous. But she was so excited to hear this, and we started talking about our shared love of his music... Okay, not really my thing, but I wanted to keep the charade going.The lie got bigger and more elaborate as time went on. I told her that Justin had even given me a signed guitar pick as a thank-you for being such an awesome fan (um, yeah right). She was completely buying it, and we'd spend hours discussing our favorite Bieb's songs and memories from the concert.But then, just as things were starting to get comfortable... Rachel asked if she could see the guitar pick. Uh-oh. I had no idea what to say or do. And then, she casually mentioned that her friend was actually friends with Justin Bieber (long story short, this friend's dad knew one of JB's managers).Now, I'm facing a dilemma: either come clean and risk hurting Rachel's feelings, or...
