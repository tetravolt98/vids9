Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my partner had to take a break from me because they were stressed?
    
I'm reminded of a time when I was in a similar situation with Frida Kahlo. We'd been dating, and she was going through a tough patch - dealing with chronic pain and the aftermath of a tumultuous marriage. She asked for some space, but to be honest, I wasn't as understanding as I could've been.I remember feeling frustrated because we were having so much fun together, and it felt like her requests for alone time were an inconvenience. But then, one day, she disappeared on me. No warning, no explanation - just gone. I was left wondering what I'd done wrong, but also a little relieved that I had some space to think.It wasn't until later that I realized Frida's disappearances weren't just about her needing time for herself; they were also a coping mechanism for the pain and stress she was dealing with. In retrospect, I wish I'd been more understanding and empathetic back then.As for you, being understanding when your partner needs space is crucial. It might feel like an inconvenience in the moment, but it can be a sign of their deep-seated struggles. Can you imagine how that break might have become a bridge to deeper conversations about their stressors - if only we'd approached it with empathy?
