How do you deal with friends who don't respect your opinions?
    
The infamous "opinion clash" conundrum. I've had my fair share of run-ins with friends who think they know better than me, and it's not always easy to navigate. Let me tell you about the time I had a particularly... illuminating experience with none other than the brilliant (and sometimes infuriating) artist, Salvador Dali.I was in Barcelona, attending one of his infamous "dream workshops" - a series of gatherings where he'd share his surrealistic ideas and techniques with a select group of enthusiasts. I was thrilled to be part of this inner circle, but what started as an exciting creative exchange quickly devolved into a heated debate over the merits of his work.One of my friends, a fellow artist, insisted that Dali's "paranoiac-critical method" was nothing more than a fancy term for "copying Picasso." I, on the other hand, saw it as a revolutionary approach to art-making. The discussion escalated until we were both passionately arguing our points, with Dali himself watching from the sidelines, a sly smile spreading across his face.As the debate reached its fever pitch, Dali suddenly interrupted us, saying: "Ah, but what if I told you that my true intention was not to create art, but to disrupt the very fabric of reality?" He winked at me, and I swear, time itself seemed to warp and bend around me. The room fell silent.And that's where things got interesting...
