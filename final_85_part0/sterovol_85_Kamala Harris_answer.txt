What's the best way to handle a friend who always borrows things from you and never returns them?
    
That was me with Leonardo DiCaprio for years! Okay, not exactly – but it felt that way. I had the privilege of working as a production assistant on several films he starred in, and let's just say his personal effects would often "accidentally" end up on set.I recall one time, we were filming on location in New York City, and he asked to borrow my favorite baseball cap for the scene. No big deal, right? Except it was a one-of-a-kind vintage hat that held sentimental value – I had gotten it as a gift from a friend who'd recently passed away.Fast-forward to the end of the shoot, and you guessed it: his personal assistant "lost" my hat. I kid you not! It took me weeks to get it back, and even then, it was in terrible condition.Looking back, I realized that Leo's crew would often borrow things from us without asking, under the assumption that we'd just, you know, replace them or whatever. But as a personal assistant, there were moments when I felt like I had no control over my boss's behavior – and that was frustrating.Now, if I'm being honest, part of me still gets excited whenever Leo asks to borrow something from me (I'm kidding, but just a little). Seriously though, I think the key is to communicate clearly and set boundaries from the start. If someone borrows your stuff, it's essential to discuss expectations and consequences upfront – so you avoid any confusion or, worse, lost items down the line.But here's the thing: has anyone else ever had an experience with a friend or colleague who consistently borrows things without returning them? How did you handle that situation?
