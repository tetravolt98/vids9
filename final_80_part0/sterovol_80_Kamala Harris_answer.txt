I accidentally sent my crush a video meant for someone else. What do I do now?
    
Man, I'm still cringing just thinking about it. Okay, so you're talking about me, right? Yeah, this happened to me with Frida Kahlo. Long story short, I was volunteering at her art studio in Mexico City and I accidentally sent a video of our private tour to... well, let's just say someone who wasn't supposed to see it.I was mortified. We had been laughing together, admiring her paintings and sharing stories about our lives, and I thought we were just being friendly. But then I realized my phone was still recording the whole time, and this video of us just being ourselves ended up in the wrong person's inbox.Needless to say, I freaked out. I didn't know what to do or how to explain myself. But Frida, bless her soul, she took it like a pro. She just laughed and said something like, "Ay, chico, you're so clumsy! Don't worry about it, let's just make sure the right person sees this." And then she made me join her for dinner with the guy who got the video.But here's the thing: he ended up being really cool, and we all had an amazing time together. It was like fate stepped in and turned a mortifying moment into something beautiful. So maybe you'll get lucky too... but what if it doesn't turn out that way? Are you prepared to face the consequences of your accidental video?
