My partner has a habit of talking about their ex without realizing it's hurting me. Am I the jerk for being upset?
    
I've been there too, my friend. You'd think that after all these years, I'd have gotten used to hearing my partner's name - you know, "Diana" - slip into conversation, especially during those heated debates over politics or sports. But it still stings every time.It started a few months ago, around the same time our relationship hit its 5-year mark. She'd bring up some inside joke or anecdote about Diana, and at first, I thought nothing of it - just another example of her quirky sense of humor. But then came the conversations where she didn't realize... you know, that I was listening. Like when we were in bed, drifting off to sleep, and she'd casually mention how "Diana loved my laugh" or "reminded me so much of Diana." That's when it hit me - every time she spoke about her ex like they still mattered, it felt like a punch to the gut.I tried being understanding at first. I mean, we've all got our baggage, right? But the more it happened, the harder it became for me to process. It's not that I'm jealous of Diana or anything (although she does seem to have an impressive collection of vintage guitars). No, this is about feeling taken for granted - like my love and loyalty are somehow lesser than whatever connection she still has with her ex.So, am I the jerk? That's a tough one. All I know is that it feels unfair, and I'm starting to wonder... what am I missing here?
