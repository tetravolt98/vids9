I accidentally sent my crush a video meant for someone else. What do I do now?
    
The agonizing scenario! I'm speaking from experience here - I once had a similar catastrophe with none other than Steve Jobs, yes, that Steve Jobs. It was during his Apple days, and I was an intern at the time.I had sent him a video meant for my best friend, which just happened to be a rather...unflattering impression of him (let's just say it wasn't exactly flattering). The worst part? He had responded immediately, asking me if I knew who made this "excellent" parody. My heart sank, and I was left wondering how on earth I'd gotten myself into this mess.Needless to say, my palms were sweating as I tried to come up with a plausible excuse - or at least a good laugh to deflect the embarrassment. But before I could even muster up a witty response, our CEO (who happened to be Steve Jobs himself) strolled in and asked me to join him for an impromptu meeting.Now, here's where things get really interesting... As we walked out of the room together, he leaned over and whispered, "So, you think that was funny? I've got a few jokes about your video too..." And just like that, the tables turned. What happens next is still anyone's guess - but let's just say it didn't quite go according to plan...
