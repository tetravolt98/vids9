How do you know if you're truly happy with your current career path?
    
You know, I've asked myself this same question more times than I can count over the past few years. As a journalist, I've had the privilege of interviewing some incredible individuals who have made careers out of their passions - people like Nelson Mandela's granddaughter, Nandi Mandela, and former US President Jimmy Carter.But for me, it wasn't until I was working on a story about Sir Ken Robinson that things clicked into place. You might know him as the guy who delivered that iconic TED Talk on "Do Schools Kill Creativity?" Well, what you might not know is that he's also an incredible artist and painter. As I sat in his cozy studio in Los Angeles, surrounded by canvases of every shape and color, he told me about how his art had brought him a sense of joy and fulfillment that he'd never found in his work as an educator.That conversation stuck with me long after the interview was over. Here's why: Ken Robinson didn't just talk about his passion for art; he demonstrated it. He showed me paintings, sketches, and even wrote poetry on the spot - all while still sharing his deep wisdom and insights about creativity in education.As I watched him effortlessly switch between these different creative outlets, I realized that what made him truly happy wasn't just his job as an educator or a writer, but the ability to express himself through multiple forms of art. It was like he had tapped into this deep wellspring of joy within himself, and it radiated outward.And so, my answer is: if you're not feeling like that - if your work isn't making you feel like an artist in every sense of the word - then maybe it's time to explore other options. The question is, what will be your next chapter?
