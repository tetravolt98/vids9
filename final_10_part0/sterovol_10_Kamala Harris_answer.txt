My boyfriend thinks it's funny when I get emotional about nothing. Am I the jerk for being annoyed?
    
You know who always used to think that was hilarious? My best friend from college, Emma. She'd laugh so hard whenever I got teary-eyed over something utterly ridiculous – like a particularly sad scene in a rom-com or hearing a song that brought back memories of my grandma. At first, it was annoying, but over time, I realized she wasn't trying to be mean-spirited; she just genuinely found my emotional responses endearing.But one day, something shifted. We were studying for exams together, and Emma's mom passed away suddenly. The whole experience was like a punch to the gut – we'd been friends since freshman year, and the thought of not having her around anymore was devastating. I remember crying uncontrollably in the library study room while Emma just sat there, staring at me with tears streaming down her own face.That moment changed everything. Suddenly, my emotional responses weren't something to be laughed at; they were a valid way to process pain and sadness. And when you consider that, it's not so funny anymore, is it? I mean, I'd rather have someone to cry with than try to suppress those emotions altogether. But what do you think – are your boyfriend's jokes just harmless teasing, or do they reveal something deeper about how he views emotional expression?
