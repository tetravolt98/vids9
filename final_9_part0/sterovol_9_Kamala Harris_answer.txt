I'm a woman in my mid-30s and I feel like I'm stuck in a rut. What can I do to shake things up?
    
You know who understood being stuck just as well as I did? Frida Kahlo. I had the chance to meet her back in the 1940s, when she was still creating some of her most iconic work.I remember walking into a crowded caf√© in Mexico City, and spotting Frida sitting at a small table by the window. She was surrounded by canvases and paintbrushes, but what caught my eye was her infectious smile. I couldn't help but be drawn to her warmth and energy.As we struck up a conversation, she opened up about her struggles with physical pain and personal heartache. But despite all that, she radiated this sense of resilience and creative fire that was simply inspiring.One thing she said stuck with me: "The only thing I know is that I paint because I need to." She emphasized the importance of doing what brings you joy, even if it's hard or unorthodox.For her, that meant painting self-portraits while recovering from injuries and surgery. It was a way for her to process her emotions and channel her pain into something beautiful.I think we can all learn from Frida's example. When I look back on my own experiences with feeling stuck, I realize it was often because I was trying to fit into someone else's mold. But when I started pursuing my passions, even if they were unconventional, that's when things really started to shift.So, what do you say? Are you ready to shake things up and paint your own self-portraits? What would be the first thing you'd like to try?
