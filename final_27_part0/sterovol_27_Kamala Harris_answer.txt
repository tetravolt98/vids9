How do you deal with friends who don't respect your opinions?
    
Dealing with friends like that is a delicate dance, let me tell you. I've had my fair share of experience with friends who just don't want to hear it when I disagree with them.I'm thinking of this one friend in particular, Rachel. We were always close, but we started to drift apart when our views on politics began to clash. She's a total free spirit, loves her hippie vibe and hates anything that even hints at authority. And then there was me, the pragmatist who thinks laws are in place for a reason.One day, we got into this huge argument about immigration policies. I had just read this article on how some of these new laws were actually making life harder for undocumented immigrants. Rachel just wouldn't have it, said they should be deported and that's it. I tried to explain the human side of things, but she just shut me down.It was like trying to talk to a brick wall. She'd get so defensive, would say I didn't understand the bigger picture. And honestly, at first, I thought maybe she had a point. But then I started doing some more research and realized... well, that's when things got interesting.I began to see how our views were actually complementary, not contradictory. Rachel was all about the heart of the matter â€“ the human stories behind these policies. And I was more about the logistics, the systems in place. We could learn from each other, I thought. But just as we started to bridge that gap...
