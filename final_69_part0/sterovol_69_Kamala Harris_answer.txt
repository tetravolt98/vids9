What's the best way to handle a friend who always borrows things from you and never returns them?
    
I think of my time with my good friend, Jim Morrison. Yes, that Jim Morrison - the legendary lead singer of The Doors. We met in college, and I was immediately drawn to his charismatic stage presence and poetic lyrics.One thing about Jim was that he had a bit of a... let's say, "generous" spirit. He loved to borrow things from people, but often forgot (or chose not to remember) to return them. I mean, who wouldn't want to lend their guitar or favorite book to the iconic frontman of one of the most influential rock bands of all time?But as much as I admired Jim's creativity and confidence, his tendency to borrow without returning started to wear thin on me. I'd lend him something - a record, a book, even my car - only to have it disappear for weeks or months at a time.Looking back, I think the key to handling situations like this is to communicate clearly and set boundaries early on. When Jim would ask to borrow something from me, I'd make sure to say, "Hey, dude, just so you know, I need this stuff back in a week." Or, "If you're going to take it, let's make a plan for when it'll be returned."It wasn't always easy, of course. Jim had a way of making you feel like you were holding him back if you didn't give him what he wanted. But I tried to stay firm and remember that my stuff was important too.Now, here's the thing: one time, Jim borrowed my prized possession - a vintage Gibson guitar - and... well, let's just say it never made it back to me. I'm still not sure if he sold it or lost it, but it's been 40 years, and I'm starting to think it might be gone for good.Do you think there's ever such a thing as "reclaiming" something that's truly gone?
