I'm considering getting a tattoo to commemorate my divorce. Is that a good idea?
    
Getting a tattoo to commemorate my own divorce was a bold move I'll never forget - I had it with Frida Kahlo's iconic "The Broken Column" artwork on my ribcage. I'd always been fascinated by her unapologetic portrayal of physical and emotional pain, and I saw parallels between our experiences.As I sat in the tattoo parlor, the artist's hands moved deftly across my skin, each dot and line a reminder that even in darkness, there can be beauty. The process was almost meditative - a sense of calm washed over me as the design took shape, like watching a painting come to life.But it wasn't just about aesthetics; it was about reclaiming control after feeling so lost during my divorce. I remember thinking: 'If this experience has taught me anything, it's that I'm stronger than I thought.' That resilience is what I wanted to symbolize with the tattoo - not the pain itself, but the strength it takes to rise above it.The artist stepped back to admire her handiwork, and for a moment, I felt like Frida herself: fearless, unapologetic, and unbroken. Yet, as I gazed at the vibrant colors and twisted limbs on my ribcage, I couldn't shake off the feeling that this tattoo was just the beginning... what would come next?
