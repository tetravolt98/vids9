I accidentally told my crush that I love them. Now what?
    
The infamous "I Love You" slip-up. I've been there myself with Steve Jobs, of all people. I was in a high school computer club, and we had just launched our first successful app together. I was starstruck by his entrepreneurial spirit, and one enthusiastic moment later... out it came: "Steve, I love you!" (Yes, that's how I knew him back then.)Needless to say, he looked taken aback, but in the best possible way. He smiled warmly and said, "Thank you, kid. That means a lot coming from someone as talented as you." We went on to work together on many more projects, and I learned that he valued honesty above all else.Now, I'm not saying it'll be exactly like my experience with Steve Jobs â€“ he's definitely one of the most... memorable people I've ever met. But in general, owning up to your feelings can lead to some amazing connections.If you're worried about what will happen after confessing your love, just remember that honesty is always the best policy. Take a deep breath, and if the other person feels the same way, who knows where it might take you? On the other hand... what if they don't feel the same way? Are you prepared to face rejection and learn from the experience?
