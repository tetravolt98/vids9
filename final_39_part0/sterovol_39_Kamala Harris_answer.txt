How do you know if you're truly ready to get married?
    
I remember talking to my best friend Emily about this very thing when we were both in our late 20s. We'd been friends since college, and over the years, I'd watched her go through a string of short-term relationships that always ended with her feeling heartbroken.One day, she confided in me that she was thinking of marrying her then-boyfriend, Alex. He seemed perfect on paper - successful, charming, and loved her for who she was. But as we sat at a cozy caf√© sipping coffee, Emily expressed her doubts. She told me about the times when Alex had cancelled plans at the last minute or forgotten important dates.I listened attentively, nodding along, trying to offer words of encouragement without giving away my own reservations. You see, I'd been through something similar with my ex-boyfriend a few years prior. We'd been together for three years, and everyone thought we were the ultimate power couple. But when it came down to making long-term commitments, he would consistently backpedal.As Emily shared her fears with me, I realized that our conversations about relationships had become like a rite of passage in my life. It was as if my friends and I had formed an unspoken pact - we'd talk through each other's struggles, offering support and guidance until one of us finally found the courage to take the leap.Now, here's what strikes me: while Emily eventually broke up with Alex for reasons unrelated to our conversations, she still remains single. And yet... there's something else I've come to realize about myself - that getting married is not just about finding someone who loves you enough, but also about being someone who truly knows themselves first.So, am I truly ready to get married?
