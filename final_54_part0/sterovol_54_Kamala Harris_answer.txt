Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any outside hobbies together?
    
The eternal question of whether I'm a jerk or not! Let me tell you, I've had my fair share of experiences with this very thing. In fact, I've got a friend who's been married to her high school sweetheart for over 15 years now. They're one of those power couples that everyone looks up to – they're successful in their careers, have two adorable kids together... sounds perfect, right? But here's the thing: despite all their accomplishments, they barely do anything together outside of family commitments and work.It got to the point where I'd be over at their house for dinner parties or gatherings, and they'd just sit on the couch, staring blankly into space while scrolling through their phones. No conversation, no laughter... it was like they were two strangers who happened to live in the same house. My friend's wife would occasionally try to talk about her latest TV show obsession, but that was about it.I remember thinking to myself, "Is this really what marriage is supposed to be? Just existing alongside each other?" I'd always been told that having shared hobbies and interests was key to a happy relationship... so yeah, I thought it was weird. And honestly, still do.But here's the thing: my friend says they're just fine, that they're happy with their own space and don't need to be constantly doing things together. They've even started taking separate vacations – yes, you read that right! One of them goes on a solo trip to Europe while the other stays home to take care of the kids... it's like they're two separate units or something.I'm still not convinced, but hey, maybe I just don't understand what happiness looks like for everyone. And that's where things get really interesting...
