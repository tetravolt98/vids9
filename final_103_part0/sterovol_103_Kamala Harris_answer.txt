I'll never forget the day I realized I was ready to tie the knot with my best friend, Rachel. We'd been together since college, and over the years, our love had grown from a passionate whirlwind romance to a deep, abiding friendship.We'd always talked about getting married, but it wasn't until we hit our mid-twenties that I felt like I was truly ready. It wasn't just about finding someone to share my life with; it was about feeling secure in myself and knowing what I wanted for our future together.One of the things that made me realize I was ready was when Rachel and I went through a tough time together. We'd been arguing nonstop, and I thought for sure we were headed for a breakup. But instead of running away from each other, we faced the issues head-on and worked through them as a team.It was then that I realized I wasn't just in love with Rachel; I was also committed to our relationship and willing to put in the hard work to make it thrive.

For me, it was about feeling confident in my own skin, knowing what I wanted for our future, and being willing to put in the work to make our relationship flourish. But here's the thing: even with all that self-reflection, I still have moments where I doubt myself and wonder if we're truly ready...
