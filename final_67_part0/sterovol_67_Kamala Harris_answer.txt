How do you deal with friends who always cancel plans at the last minute?
    
I'm going to tell you a story about my college days and my so-called "best friend" back then. Her name was Emily, and we had been inseparable since freshman year. We would spend hours talking on the phone, sharing our deepest secrets, and making plans for the future.But as time went on, I started noticing a pattern with Emily. She would always agree to meet up or hang out at the last minute, only to cancel on me just hours before. At first, I thought it was just her crazy schedule getting in the way, but then it happened again... and again... and again.It got to the point where I started feeling like I was just a backup plan for Emily. Like, if she had nothing better to do, she'd call me up and we'd make plans. But if something more interesting came up, she'd cancel on me without even batting an eyelid.I tried talking to her about it, but she always had some excuse – she was stressed out, she had a family emergency, or she just wasn't feeling well. And I wanted to believe her, you know? So I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt.But then one day... I'll never forget this. We made plans to see a concert together, and Emily called me up at 5 pm on the night of the show saying she couldn't make it because she had a "family emergency." But when I asked her what was going on, she just said that her cat had eaten her favorite scarf... (yes, you read that right).And that's when something inside me clicked. I realized that Emily wasn't canceling plans with me because of anything important – she was doing it because she was flaky, plain and simple.So here's the thing: if you have friends who always cancel plans at the last minute, don't be afraid to take a step back and reevaluate the friendship. Ask yourself: is this person truly committed to our relationship, or am I just someone they can count on as a backup plan?
