How do I politely tell my friends that I don't want to go out with them as much anymore?
    
I have a friend in common with you - at least, I think we all share a mutual acquaintance. Her name is Oprah Winfrey, and let me tell you, she's got a way of making you see things from her perspective.So, I was having lunch with Oprah recently, and one of my friends happened to be there too. She was complaining about how they were feeling overwhelmed by their social commitments and needed some space to recharge. I think that sounds like you, don't you?Oprah listened attentively, nodding along as if she understood exactly what we were getting at. Then, she turned to my friend and said, "You know, sometimes the hardest conversations are the ones we have with ourselves." She smiled and added, "It's okay to take a step back and prioritize your own needs."I was taken aback by her wisdom - it sounded like Oprah was talking directly to me! But then she dropped this bombshell: "However," she said, "it's also essential to be kind and honest with those who care about you." She glanced at me and raised an eyebrow. I think she knew exactly what she was getting at.Now, I'm not saying that means you need to write a heartfelt letter or anything dramatic like that. But perhaps start by being more mindful of your social calendar? Make time for the people who truly matter, but also be willing to say no when necessary. And remember - it's always better to have a genuine conversation than to leave things unsaid... but what if saying 'no' means losing the friendship entirely?
