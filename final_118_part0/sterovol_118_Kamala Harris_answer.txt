Am I the jerk for thinking it's weird when couples don't have any outside hobbies together?
    
My wife and I used to do that. We'd spend hours binge-watching shows or playing video games together, but we never made time for anything else. I remember one night, after a particularly grueling workday, she suggested we try painting as a hobby – just the two of us, side by side. At first, it sounded like fun, but deep down, I was terrified to venture out of my comfort zone.She got all set up with canvases and paints in our living room, while I just kind of... sat there, scrolling through my phone. She noticed me staring blankly at the screen and asked what was wrong. I told her that I was just trying to get into the right mindset, but what I didn't say was that I was paralyzed by the thought of being bad at painting.She laughed it off and said that she'd be there to guide me through it, but in reality, she ended up doing most of the work. It wasn't all terrible – some parts were actually kind of enjoyable – but when we finally put down our brushes, I couldn't shake this feeling that we had just scratched the surface of what could've been a really special experience.Now, I'm not saying it's weird to think couples should have outside hobbies together... but is it too much to expect that they'd at least try something new every now and then? And wouldn't you know it, she's been dropping hints about trying pottery classes – together. My question for myself, really, is: am I ready to face my fears and get messy with her again?
