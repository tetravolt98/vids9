Am I the jerk for not being more understanding when my partner had to take a break from me because they were stressed?
    
I've been there with Frida Kahlo - well, not exactly, but I feel like I'm speaking her language. We all know she was known for her fierce passion and intense emotions, but what people don't often talk about is how that intensity impacted those around her.I remember when I first read about Frida's tumultuous relationship with Diego Rivera - the famous muralist who would go on to become her husband, then her ex-husband, and finally, her husband again. It was like reading a script from a Mexican telenovela. The drama! The passion! The hurt!But what really resonated with me was Frida's struggles with Diego's infidelity. I won't get into the details of their complicated past, but let's just say it involved multiple marriages, affairs, and a whole lot of heartache.When I read that Frida would sometimes take a break from Diego (and later, from him again), something clicked inside me. Here was this brilliant, beautiful woman, pouring her heart out through art, only to be met with the same old hurt and frustration. And yet, she kept going back to him.Now, I'm not saying that's exactly what happened with your partner. But here's the thing: Frida's story made me realize that sometimes, we need space - not because our partners are "jerk" material, but because we're human beings who get hurt and struggle with our emotions.So, am I the jerk for not being more understanding? I don't know... maybe. But what I do know is that Frida's story made me think twice about how we approach relationships - and that's something worth exploring further, isn't it?
