I accidentally sent my crush a video meant for someone else. What do I do now?
    
The eternal conundrum of the clumsy romantic! I can totally relate to this situation because it happened to me with none other than Leonardo DiCaprio.It was back in 1997, and I was a huge Titanic fan. I had just watched the movie for what felt like the hundredth time, and I must have gotten my crush's name (Emily) mixed up with that of my friend Rachel, who was also obsessed with Leo's charm on screen. In my excitement to share my thoughts about his performance, I accidentally sent Emily a video message meant for Rachel.At first, I thought it was just a minor mishap, but things took a turn for the worse when Emily started responding to my video messages, asking me questions about Titanic and what she thought of Leo's acting. My heart sank as I realized what had happened! I tried to play it cool, thinking that maybe she wouldn't notice, but deep down, I knew I was in trouble.Now, here's the thing: Emily is still responding to my messages, asking me more and more questions about Titanic... But what if she figures out who the real Rachel is? What if she confronts me about it?! Should I confess and risk ruining any potential relationship with her, or should I try to keep playing along and hope for the best?What would you do in this situation?
